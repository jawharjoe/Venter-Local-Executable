Please take a look next to the temple behind your office and see the permanent garbage pile which stinks nonstop. Please see how garbage is merely swept up into piles all over 33-36 Cross / 22nd - 18th Main areas (all around your office) instead of being collected by the sweepers and by the garbage autos. This is prime area with judges  senior executives  industrialists etc staying here (although everyone has the right to a clean street!)
