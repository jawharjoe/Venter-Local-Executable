Bad Patches,Respected Sri Vijaya Kumar \nThis is to highlight the fact that even around your office in 4th T Block  the cleanliness of the streets and collection of garbage is very poor. Please take a look next to the temple behind your office and see the permanent garbage pile which stinks nonstop. Please see how garbage is merely swept up into piles all over 33-36 Cross / 22nd - 18th Main areas (all around your office) instead of being collected by the sweepers and by the garbage autos. This is prime area with judges  senior executives  industrialists etc staying here (although everyone has the right to a clean street!) Trust you will have the concerned people from BVG India do  their job properly. In order to avoid harassment by BBMP workers I have not provided my actual mobile number.

Bad Patches,NGEF Road coming on to Old Madras Road: There are no markings for a stop line  or pedestrian crossing  on NGEF road. Since there is no stop line marked  the stop line is up to the imagination of impatient drivers. During the absence of a police person  the impatient drivers encroach and fill the slowest lane of Old Madras Road (OMR). This makes it hard for a \nmotorist travelling east on the slowest (leftmost) lane (OMR)  who must change over the middle east-bound OMR lane. Further  if the lights just change from green to red (there appears to be a very short change-over time I noted few weeks ago)  on east-bound OMR  slowest lane  the impatient drivers on NGEF road already proceed in south direction. This makes chances of an accident very high.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n 1. Draw stop line  pedestrian crossing lines  on South-bound NGEF road.\n 2. Check traffic light switch-over timings (when in automatic mode) at NGEF/OMR intersection.\n\nBEBEFIT:\n 1. Makes it better for pedestrians  East bound traffic on OMR  and for police to manage.\n 2. Safety/accident prevention.\n\n(If someone has photos they can load of the intersection  it will be very helpful)\n\nThank you.,Bad Patches,Drainage chokes and blockages,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Private Land   Building   Society   Factories,Despite the mostly one  or two  guards  people can still end up in the tracks either by design  or by accident  when a metro train comes.\n(The situation is not very different than this week\'s tragic Delhi Zoo incident). The risk of people falling into the track is higher when more people start using the metro.\n\nShould/when this happens  the only thing an ordinary guard is most likely to do is to blow his whistle. I do not believe the ordinary guards \nare trained to  or will be inclined to  get on an electrified track on the path of an oncoming train to save someone. Prevention is the best way. \nMechanisms are available to make it hard for people to jump or fall to the track altogether. Examples of automated barriers  used in the Singapore Metro  are attached. Bangalore Metro can take the lead  and set example in safety. It is better to install prevention mechanisms sooner  than later.\n\nMentioning for Byappanahalli Metro Station.

Unauthorised construction development,"On a recent interaction with the Indiranagar RTO  I noticed that seating capacity was only for about five (ordinary) customers. However  I would conservatively estimate the average number of customers at the RTO to be  say sixty. Dividing 60 by 5  we get 12. I would interpret this to mean that the RTO is operating in twelve times less space (for ordinary customers) than what it should be. The RTO must be in this building since the last 30 or more years. During my three visits to the RTO  I must have visited seven to eight different counters  and waited in at least five different queues.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n1. Can the RTO move into a new space where the LAYOUT is such that a large number of customers (say two hundred chairs are there) sit in the center  and all counters are in the periphery? This setup  or layout  would be similar to the setup in a \""railway ticket booking center\""  or ICICI bank.\nQueue numbers can be given out on a fisrt-come-first-serve basis via a machine  or manually.\n\n2. Can the RTO re-engineer their PROCESSES so that the customer can get their work done by going to any one of multiple one window only Technology will need to be used here.\n\nBENEFIT:\n1.

Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,I am staying near Netaji Circle and recently they did a Good thing of not allowing public to put waste in the road. It is really needed. But the authority should come and collect the waste from the apartment. If we are inside the apartment we won\'t know if someone is in the road to collect waste. I happen to see they come around 6 AM in the morning and people like me come from Night shift and will be sleeping. It is becoming difficult for us. \n\nThey could charge the apartment people some nominal fee say around 30-50 per month for collecting the waste.

Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,I have one idea in my mind regarding garbage disposal in Bangalore. I see large heaps of garbage disposed open around the roads and corners in the city that give it a horrible sight. \nWe can start one campaign wherein each company can contribute to donate one large bin for waste disposal. The waste can be collected by the BBMP on daily basis as they usually do. \nWe always expect BBMP to take action for everything which I feel is helpless due to shortage of funds or other reasons. This initiative will at least raise a sense of responsibility among the corporates in city  who can make big change by contributing a bit to maintain the beauty of the city. I am writing this in hope that this will be taken up as a city wide campaign to make a change.\nThanks and regards \nAnita Kalia,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage lorry not reported for service

Odour  foul smell  from drains,From past 2 weeks  our neighbourhood(Talacauvery nagar and Veerabhadra nagar) is receiving Cauvery water with green colour organic content in it.

Bad Patches,This is to mention about the lack of roads/road full of potholes in the stretch from HAL signal to the BEML gate   approximately around 2 kms.  There is absolutely no road at all in that 2 km stretch and this is absolutely difficult for a two wheeler commuter to pass through if a big vehicle like a bus passes by as the road is half the size of a normal road and due to the dust arose by the passing of the bus.  Half of the road is covered with barricades  for no reason which makes it only one way for most part of it.   And once you reach the Jeevan Bhima Nagar road   after that there are so many piles of stones created due to the process of laying Road activity which had started three months back and left in between.Since there are no streetlights too in this 3/4th of a km passage it makes it extremely difficult for one to spot the road which doesnt have a stone/hole in it.  To make it worse the BMTC buses coming from the opposite side [BEML bus stop] come in the wrong way[due to the non-existence of a road] resulting in chaos.,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Sweeping of road

Bad Patches,This is to bring to your notice that from Gottigere busstop to NICE Road junction there are nearly more than 80-100 potholes which are not fixed since 4-5 months. BWSSB dug up the road and never asphalted it  leaving the road in such a bad shape that vehicles literally crawl everyday. The potholes are so dangerous that every day at least 10 bikers and 5 autos fall  which is too vulnerable for accidents.  Adding to it  the road from Lal Bahdur shastri nagar has opened which causes more traffic jam near the nice road junction  and no traffic police will come and clear the mess. Request concerned officials immediately asphalt the road properly  just fixing potholes will not serve the cause.,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property,Minor repairs to municipal property

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,There are about 30-40 Software companies in RMZ ecospace  Pritech and other tech parks in the area. People coming from the Silk board direction and going towards Marathalli side have to cross the road to catch a bus or to enter the tech park. Since this is Outer Ring road  there will be a lot of high speed traffic. Between 8-11 AM and 5-7 PM  lot of people cross the road. This leads to a lot of traffic jam and also poses a great risk to people crossing the road. The solution proposed is to construct a skywalk in the mentioned location.This will drastically reduce the risk to pedestrians\' lives and reduce traffic problem.

Unauthorised construction development,"Two Unauthorised sheds were constructed on 1st Sep 2014  at entrance to second (Left) street of Samrudhi Layout  obstructing traffic.

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,The night photo taken from inside the car is at 100 feet road  and CMH Road junction  in Indiranagar; on CMH Road  facing East  towards CMH hospital. The issue is that the count-down time display is not visible due to a solid tree-branch obstructing the driver\'s view. This non-visibility of signal count-down timer  causes un-necessary anxiety among already impatient Bangalore motorists.\n\n(Another photo is of the counter taken during day is also attached)\n\nThe responsible authorities are requested to address the issue of signal change count-down non-visibility  from CMH road  facing CMH hospital at this junction. My suggestion is that some **mechanical fixtures to used to re-locate the counter to a visible location  and the tree branch not be harmed**.\n\nHaving a signal count-down timer visible from CMH Road  facing CMH hospital  will serve the purpose it was meant to serve. \n\nIt is again requested that the tree not be harmed. Repeat: request tree not be harmed.\n\nThank you.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Municipal Plot
Hawkers,BACKGROUND: \nSince the metro commissioned and Byappanahalli Metro station inaugurated  my family  I and others have the reason to cross Old Madras Road (OMR). While the metro station is very nice  and the metro convenient  crossing Old Madras Road  is not easy. This is especially hard for the elderly  those with children  and dangerous for all pedestrians. Many school children also take the metro  and cross old madras road. Apart from watching out to avoid on-road traffic while crossing  there is a bus stop where buses come towards pedestrians  parked vehicles coming in  or starting out (some coming to visit food vendors)  which make it a fairly harrowing experience for pedestrians to cross the road  especially during peak hours.\n\nIn addition  the driving is tense for motorists (on OMR  as well as the side road)  as there is vehicular traffic  as well as  pedestrians (who may cross anywhere on the road) at this junction. \n\nSome photographs of the junction are attached.\n\nDespite the Byappanahalli Metro Station and service  the last mile connectivity for pedestrians needs some more work.\n\nI had written to BMRCL and a couple of BBMP officials inquiring about plans for a skywalk  and got no response. On asking Byannapahalli Namma Metro Customer Care  I was informed they are not aware of any pedestrian sky-bridge across from this metro station for C V Raman Nagar.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n It is requested that a pedestrian skywalk be built across Old Madras Road to access the Byappanahalli Metro station  bus-stops across the street. Apart from stairs  ramps are also requested to be incorporated into the pedestrian sky-bridge as it will make it easy for wheel-chair bound commuters  families with young children (pushing strollers)  or those passengers with light wheelable luggage). A drawing proposal is attached in this regard. (Pavement space right across from Byappanahalli Metro station is narrow. Therefore the pedestrian skywalk will need to be off-set a bit. Roof  and efficient lighting are assumed).\n\n(BTW  the Swami Vivekananda Pedestrian Skywalk is very convenient for normally abled pedestrians to cross Old Madras Road. An image example of a staircase + ramp pedestrian skybridge from IMM  near Jurong East  Singapore is attached)\n\nAt the same time  authorities could look to de-congest the intersection  by creating designated space for different activities  to avoid traffic bottlenecks.\n\nBENEFIT\n The following benefits are envisioned once a pedestrian sky-bridge is put in place: \n  1. Pedestrian safety => MOST IMPORTANT\n  2. Metro and bus commuter convenience\n  3. Driver comfort of motorists on OMR and S.G.Palya Roads\n  4. Smoother transportation flow & better quality of life for all\n\nThank you!,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches

Drainage chokes and blockages,Respected Sir  I would like to bring this to your notice that the drainage (5X5 feet approx) next to my compound is left open. The other part of the drainage is covered and is used as a foot path having gaps in between  which is enough for a person to fall. During monsoon this area being low lying gets submerged under water causing grave danger to the pedestrian  who mistakenly walk on this path which may be fatal.
