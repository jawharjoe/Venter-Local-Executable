I suppose the whole of the city can have markers to locate my complaint. There is no proper place to dump the garbage in any locality. Of course we have persons to collect the garbage from every house but they do not have a proper place to converge and dispose. I would like to know why the BBMP is not stirctly enforcing the segregation of waste generated at source. This can reduce so much of garbage on the roads and also reduce the need for so much of landfills. Please be considerate.,Collection point not attended properly,Silt to be lifted on road,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point

Respected Sri Vijaya Kumar \nThis is to highlight the fact that even around your office in 4th T Block  the cleanliness of the streets and collection of garbage is very poor. Please take a look next to the temple behind your office and see the permanent garbage pile which stinks nonstop. Please see how garbage is merely swept up into piles all over 33-36 Cross / 22nd - 18th Main areas (all around your office) instead of being collected by the sweepers and by the garbage autos. This is prime area with judges  senior executives  industrialists etc staying here (although everyone has the right to a clean street!) Trust you will have the concerned people from BVG India do  their job properly. In order to avoid harassment by BBMP workers I have not provided my actual mobile number. Thank you.\n-Shankar,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Odour  foul smell  from drains
The traffic along 24th main road from Marenahalli signal lights upto brigade millennium has increased to such an extent that it is difficult to cross the road for pedestrians. They are at risk of getting hit by vehicles. Moreover  the traffic is completely indisciplined and the lack of a divider causes more chaos. The BBMP should look into the matter and install a road divider at the earliest to facilitate easy movement of traffic and prevent pedestrians getting caught while trying to cross the road.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Unauthorised construction development

Today  Reliance Communication Contractors have started digging St. Johns Church Road  near Lake Side Hospital and HDFC Bank Ulsoor. This is the third time they are digging this road in the last 3 months. When we demanded the permit  they showed a permit which only gives permission from Kensington Road to Venkatachalam Circle. Because there is no supervision from BBMp  these companies are misusing the permits. The contractor\'s representative refused to give a copy of the permit.
