I suppose the whole of the city can have markers to locate my complaint. There is no proper place to dump the garbage in any locality. Of course we have persons to collect the garbage from every house but they do not have a proper place to converge and dispose.

This can reduce so much of garbage on the roads and also reduce the need for so much of landfills.

Respected Sri Vijaya Kumar \nThis is to highlight the fact that even around your office in 4th T Block  the cleanliness of the streets and collection of garbage is very poor. Please take a look next to the temple behind your office and see the permanent garbage pile which stinks nonstop. Please see how garbage is merely swept up into piles all over 33-36 Cross / 22nd - 18th Main areas (all around your office) instead of being collected by the sweepers and by the garbage autos. This is prime area with judges  senior executives  industrialists etc staying here (although everyone has the right to a clean street!) Trust you will have the concerned people from BVG India do  their job properly. In order to avoid harassment by BBMP workers I have not provided my actual mobile number.

The traffic along 24th main road from Marenahalli signal lights upto brigade millennium has increased to such an extent that it is difficult to cross the road for pedestrians. They are at risk of getting hit by vehicles. Moreover  the traffic is completely indisciplined and the lack of a divider causes more chaos. The BBMP should look into the matter and install a road divider at the earliest to facilitate easy movement of traffic and prevent pedestrians getting caught while trying to cross the road.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Unauthorised construction development

NGEF Road coming on to Old Madras Road: There are no markings for a stop line  or pedestrian crossing  on NGEF road. Since there is no stop line marked  the stop line is up to the imagination of impatient drivers. During the absence of a police person  the impatient drivers encroach and fill the slowest lane of Old Madras Road (OMR). This makes it hard for a \nmotorist travelling east on the slowest (leftmost) lane (OMR)  who must change over the middle east-bound OMR lane. Further  if the lights just change from green to red (there appears to be a very short change-over time I noted few weeks ago)  on east-bound OMR  slowest lane  the impatient drivers on NGEF road already proceed in south direction. This makes chances of an accident very high.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n 1. Draw stop line  pedestrian crossing lines  on South-bound NGEF road.\n 2. Check traffic light switch-over timings (when in automatic mode) at NGEF/OMR intersection.\n\nBEBEFIT:\n 1. Makes it better for pedestrians  East bound traffic on OMR  and for police to manage.\n 2. Safety/accident prevention.\n\n(If someone has photos they can load of the intersection  it will be very helpful)\n\nThank you.,Bad Patches,Drainage chokes and blockages,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Despite the mostly one  or two  guards  people can still end up in the tracks either by design  or by accident  when a metro train comes.\n(The situation is not very different than this week\'s tragic Delhi Zoo incident). The risk of people falling into the track is higher when more people start using the metro.\n\nShould/when this happens  the only thing an ordinary guard is most likely to do is to blow his whistle. I do not believe the ordinary guards \nare trained to  or will be inclined to  get on an electrified track on the path of an oncoming train to save someone. Prevention is the best way. \nMechanisms are available to make it hard for people to jump or fall to the track altogether. Examples of automated barriers  used in the Singapore Metro  are attached. Bangalore Metro can take the lead  and set example in safety. It is better to install prevention mechanisms sooner  than later.\n\nMentioning for Byappanahalli Metro Station. Applicable to ALL metro stations.\n\nAction Needed:\n Install automated barriers to prevent track access by commuters.\n\nBenefit:\n Will prevent any tragic  or close call  events on Bangalore metro tracks.,Private Land   Building   Society   Factories,Unauthorised Stalls and Huts on nallas,Drainage chokes and blockages
"On a recent interaction with the Indiranagar RTO  I noticed that seating capacity was only for about five (ordinary) customers. However  I would conservatively estimate the average number of customers at the RTO to be  say sixty. Dividing 60 by 5  we get 12. I would interpret this to mean that the RTO is operating in twelve times less space (for ordinary customers) than what it should be. The RTO must be in this building since the last 30 or more years. During my three visits to the RTO  I must have visited seven to eight different counters  and waited in at least five different queues.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n1. Can the RTO move into a new space where the LAYOUT is such that a large number of customers (say two hundred chairs are there) sit in the center  and all counters are in the periphery? This setup  or layout  would be similar to the setup in a \""railway ticket booking center\""  or ICICI bank.\nQueue numbers can be given out on a fisrt-come-first-serve basis via a machine  or manually.\n\n2. Can the RTO re-engineer their PROCESSES so that the customer can get their work done by going to any one of multiple one window only Technology will need to be used here.\n\nBENEFIT:\n1. With improved  customer-centric  office layout: Improved customer experience  comfort  transparency of operations. This setup also enables \""one-counter\"" model. Such a setup also makes it easier to give priority to senior citizens etc.\n2.

"I have been in Bangalore for 2 years but never got a chance to visit Lal Bagh.

I am staying near Netaji Circle and recently they did a Good thing of not allowing public to put waste in the road. It is really needed. But the authority should come and collect the waste from the apartment. If we are inside the apartment we won\'t know if someone is in the road to collect waste. I happen to see they come around 6 AM in the morning and people like me come from Night shift and will be sleeping. It is becoming difficult for us. \n\nThey could charge the apartment people some nominal fee say around 30-50 per month for collecting the waste.

I have one idea in my mind regarding garbage disposal in Bangalore. I see large heaps of garbage disposed open around the roads and corners in the city that give it a horrible sight. \nWe can start one campaign wherein each company can contribute to donate one large bin for waste disposal. The waste can be collected by the BBMP on daily basis as they usually do. \nWe always expect BBMP to take action for everything which I feel is helpless due to shortage of funds or other reasons. This initiative will at least raise a sense of responsibility among the corporates in city  who can make big change by contributing a bit to maintain the beauty of the city.

Dear Commissioner BBMP  Bannerghatta road is one of the important roads in Bangalore. The particular stretch between Meenakshi temple and Jayadeva flyover junction gets flooded whenever there is rain. There is no proper rain water drains at the side of the road and wherever there is one it is filled with silt and debris. The channels that were made at some places slope towards the road and not in to the drains. It appears that after the road is initially made in to a double road with a median  no maintenance is done for it. If an existing road only is not maintained how can we believe that new proposal to widen the road will be done in right earnest?

This is to mention about the lack of roads/road full of potholes in the stretch from HAL signal to the BEML gate   approximately around 2 kms.  There is absolutely no road at all in that 2 km stretch and this is absolutely difficult for a two wheeler commuter to pass through if a big vehicle like a bus passes by as the road is half the size of a normal road and due to the dust arose by the passing of the bus.  Half of the road is covered with barricades  for no reason which makes it only one way for most part of it.   And once you reach the Jeevan Bhima Nagar road   after that there are so many piles of stones created due to the process of laying Road activity which had started three months back and left in between.Since there are no streetlights too in this 3/4th of a km passage it makes it extremely difficult for one to spot the road which doesnt have a stone/hole in it.  To make it worse the BMTC buses coming from the opposite side [BEML bus stop] come in the wrong way[due to the non-existence of a road] resulting in chaos.,Bad Patches,Sweeping of road,Minor repairs to municipal property

This is to bring to your notice that from Gottigere busstop to NICE Road junction there are nearly more than 80-100 potholes which are not fixed since 4-5 months. BWSSB dug up the road and never asphalted it  leaving the road in such a bad shape that vehicles literally crawl everyday. The potholes are so dangerous that every day at least 10 bikers and 5 autos fall  which is too vulnerable for accidents.  Adding to it  the road from Lal Bahdur shastri nagar has opened which causes more traffic jam near the nice road junction  and no traffic police will come and clear the mess.

The Water Drainages on the sides of the road have gone missing  of late  in many roads. Eg. Kanakapura Road from Jaraganahalli Circle to Yelachenahalli. When it rains  there is no drain path to water. The water just flows on the road. Add to this the water coming down from the Metro on top via the pillars is also left to the road. BMRCL should make pits in the median  available & direct water there. This will also add to water harvesting.

BACKGROUND: \nSince the metro commissioned and Byappanahalli Metro station inaugurated  my family  I and others have the reason to cross Old Madras Road (OMR). While the metro station is very nice  and the metro convenient  crossing Old Madras Road  is not easy. This is especially hard for the elderly  those with children  and dangerous for all pedestrians. Many school children also take the metro  and cross old madras road. Apart from watching out to avoid on-road traffic while crossing  there is a bus stop where buses come towards pedestrians  parked vehicles coming in  or starting out (some coming to visit food vendors)  which make it a fairly harrowing experience for pedestrians to cross the road  especially during peak hours.\n\nIn addition  the driving is tense for motorists (on OMR  as well as the side road)  as there is vehicular traffic  as well as  pedestrians (who may cross anywhere on the road) at this junction. \n\nSome photographs of the junction are attached.\n\nDespite the Byappanahalli Metro Station and service  the last mile connectivity for pedestrians needs some more work.\n\nI had written to BMRCL and a couple of BBMP officials inquiring about plans for a skywalk  and got no response. On asking Byannapahalli Namma Metro Customer Care  I was informed they are not aware of any pedestrian sky-bridge across from this metro station for C V Raman Nagar.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n It is requested that a pedestrian skywalk be built across Old Madras Road to access the Byappanahalli Metro station  bus-stops across the street. Apart from stairs  ramps are also requested to be incorporated into the pedestrian sky-bridge as it will make it easy for wheel-chair bound commuters  families with young children (pushing strollers)  or those passengers with light wheelable luggage). A drawing proposal is attached in this regard. (Pavement space right across from Byappanahalli Metro station is narrow. Therefore the pedestrian skywalk will need to be off-set a bit. Roof  and efficient lighting are assumed).\n\n(BTW  the Swami Vivekananda Pedestrian Skywalk is very convenient for normally abled pedestrians to cross Old Madras Road. An image example of a staircase + ramp pedestrian skybridge from IMM  near Jurong East  Singapore is attached)\n\nAt the same time  authorities could look to de-congest the intersection  by creating designated space for different activities  to avoid traffic bottlenecks.\n\nBENEFIT\n The following benefits are envisioned once a pedestrian sky-bridge is put in place: \n  1. Pedestrian safety => MOST IMPORTANT\n  2. Metro and bus commuter convenience\n  3. Driver comfort of motorists on OMR and S.G.Palya Roads\n  4. Smoother transportation flow & better quality of life for all\n\nThank you!,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches

Hi Friends \n\nThere are four garbage dumps withing 1km distance near NarayanaPura Cross in Hegde Nagar.\n1. One close to Hegde nagar bus stop towards Nagawara main raod. Where thousands of people stand everyday.\n2. A big dump yard near Rastrothana Vidya Kendra School which is also enriched with leaking drainage water that made whole situation pathetic. This is the place many children pass-by  spend whole day & play around.\n3. Another dump yard just adjacent to the wall of Indiragandhi School (sorry if the name is incorrect)  which is quite opposite to Rastothana Vidya Kendra in NarayanPura cirlce. Again many kids do play around this place.\n4. Next one is near B.P Petrol bunk (Double Road)  again many passerby this place for fuel.\n\nCan you imagine how fast a disease can spread if it attacks a Kid in school or a person standing in bus stop (touch wood)..? \nI challenge everyone reading this post to stand for 5mins near to dump yard just about 20mts from Rastrothana School.\n\nDo you think Hegde Nagar is safe to live..?\nHope the mess will be cleared very soon... Whoever concerned  thanks to you in advance for addressing this issue.\n\nBest Regards \nSuresh Kadali,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Trade without License,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Unauthorised dumping of garbage at a spot where leaves and street trash is usually swept. On a regular day it is 2% of the amount in the picture. We understand that the sub contractors next to our ward has instructed all his garbage autos/trucks to come and dump it there  which is one road next to his ward. \nFor all garbage in the area to be targeted to that one single spot is uncalled for. After repeated follow ups the entire day  we have been taken for a ride.  The current rains have made it extremely unsanitary and a terrible stench. There is a unreliable transformer right by it  which has sparked in the past..\nThe garbage has doubled since complaining in the morning and no one is here to provide the necessary services.\nOr kindly advice where we may be able to lodge a complaint for such behavior by people appointed by our representatives.,Providing removing replacing dustbins,Collection point not attended properly,Garbage not lifted from house gully

The mainly under the yeshwanthpur metro station as the water leaks from the pipes many times and erode the roads causing potholes and the potholes are filled multiple times but the water leakage is yet to be addressed. if the department can fill the potholes multiple times spending lot of money instead they can address the cause and give a end to it instead of filling potholes every now and then. most times they are not addressed till months. i have seen this issue in the whole NH4 Highway. service road are also worst and yet to be addressed,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property,Minor repairs to municipal property

A U turn at NH4 towards Yeshwanthpur have been blocked as there are some local buses and two wheelers are coming from the wrong side and moving towards Dabaspet and Thumkur. Instead of controlling them by a traffic police with fine they have blocked the U Turn itself. Traffic moving on the correct direction have to round about more than 1 km. Please get this cleared and depute a traffic inspector to control the traffic who take a wrong route. This U turn is after 8th mile at Thumkur Road. When asked a traffic inspector at the 8th mile signal he had no patience to listen and was yelling and he said that was blocked by the traffic police itself to avoid the vehicle moving from the wrong direction. What could be done for the vehicles moving on correct direction? Due to this there is a heavy traffic jam at 8th mile signal.

Dear BBMP. You posted that the complaint is acted on and the issue is resolved. so the resolution is just for 2-3 months? Now there are bigger potholes and vehicles can harldy move without making a damaging motion into these holes on the roads. whats the problem with your contractors  who fill in concrete with not much thinking into how long these will stay there? currently all potholes are back and in full force to reduce the traffic movement. already we have a signal timing of 180secs on the junction  and added to that these potholes make sure that only 10 vehicles pass thru the signal. please act up. thanks,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Also  with such a condition of drains  we do anticipate flooding of the area during rains as well. Condition of the property right across the lane is pathetic with large amounts of garbage & construction debris strewn across that property. Dust levels into our apartments have increased significantly due to the debris dumped thereÃ¢â‚¬â€œ even with closing our balcony doors.

This is right beside the wall of the Isolation hospital and behind the S.V.Road metro station  next to an auto garage. The garbage gets collected in the mornings in a small van with small rakes and dust collectors when really it needs a large truck and giant collector. Anyway  the garbage comes right back in half an hour  because people from the nearby slum New Byapanahalli walk over and chuck stuff-- factory residue  old clothes  discarded food  directly on to the street. The rest of the day you have numerous cows  dogs  crows. In the past this was not a residential neighborhood  now the buildings are right next to it. This location is actually the wrong location-- it blocks the street (along with trucks and buses belonging to an illegal building that was recently demolished on 1st Cross)  birds fly up to our balconies with food bits  and there are numerous flies. Being right next to the Isolation hospital it also must affect their hygiene. Since the garbage comes from the colony at the other end of the street it should be moved making it more convenient for them  and hopefully they will then place it into the correct space rather than throw garbage like projectiles  splashing open everywhere.

I felt I must share a pertinent issue being faced by many commuters in Whitefield  and a possible solution with you. Please read this and share your thoughts on how we can take this forward.  Issue: As a daily commuter from Whitefield Hoskote Main Road to EPIP Industrial area  my journey that should take less than 20 mins  is now crossing 1.5hrs (in the morning around 9 am onwards). The reason is the traffic jam starting from Hope Farm junction  continuing till ITPL. Cars  Trucks  Water tankers  Cabs  Volvos â€“ all are crammed one behind the other and inch forward at less than a snailâ€™s pace. To add to the woes  a large portion of the ITPL main road has been dug up  further reducing the width of the road by half. This is not a sustainable situation and I shudder to think what will happen once the metro construction starts in Whitefield.  Solution: Instead of all cars being forced to use the ITPL main road  I came across this road called â€˜Hoodi Sadaramangala roadâ€™  which is the mud road that runs parallel to the railway track  from Kadugodi to Hoodi. This road is currently in very bad shape as it is a mud road and it is extremely bumpy if traveled on in a car. It is unusable on a daily basis  as of now. The good news  however  is that it provides a quick commute to Hoodi circle  bypassing all roadblocks  and the distance is hardly 5 km. From Hoodi  it is very easy to reach the EPIP area. If we can somehow get the BBMP authorities to tar up this arterial road  I believe we will have many happy commuters  fewer jams on the main roads and most of all  peace of mind for people at forced to go through Hope Farm Junction.    Update: I have posted a photo taken a day ago of the current road condition,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Unauthorised construction development

We are the residents of Vadderapalya living with pitiable amenities in this area.Our road conditions are pathetic with big big pot holes.As such there is no road at all  connected roads are from Vadderaplaya bus stop till Sai garden layout no access of roads at all.If rain comes   to reach main road  it will be an exploratory for vehicle commuters.All vehicle commuters   in specific night to drive very complicated since there is no street lights as well ion the road.We are clue less why BBMP authorities  are completely ignored our area.This area is very far for development.Not only roads there are no streetlights as well  for pedestrians to walk in the night time will be terrible due to snakes as well street dogs.Many school buses /vans are coming inside the layout to pick the child  horrific times for drivers as well child due to pathetic road conditions.Now a days drivers are agreeing to come inside the layout and pick the child due to dreadful roads.Vehicle commuters will be obvious where the potholes will be  it will be completely blind drive.Also in summer season   mosquitoes  are spread in entire area.After 6 pm to walk on the streets will be a dangerous experience. Since there is a open drain going very close to residential layouts .Due to this mosquitoes are spread in this area  different kind of diseases are scattering in this locality.We never saw mosquito fogging is going in this area.Also garbage /waste dump yards became more in this area   since there garbage vehicle not coming regularly.There is no other option for residents   wherever there is empty place garbage is developing in a steep.Our locality is very close to city limits and also there is school as well however  BBMP authorities completely ignored our area.

Its the only entry and exit for 5 techparks on the stretch. Over 2 Lakh commuters in these parks and growing. Unsafe/uncivilized traffic - major stress for me and my colleagues. Its a shame such high tax payers have to bear with unregulated traffic riot. This can be resolved by opening up gates to both sides of ORR through 4 way signals and strict traffic regulation.

Cauvery water is coming to my area since last 8 months  but we are not getting water and complained several times at BWSSB  Ramamurthy nagar office. Now we are started getting minimum water bills even though we are not getting water. We spent more than Rs 6600/- in 2006 to get cauvery water connection. Again we paid around Rs 4000/- in May 2013. BWSSB guys just came and gave the physical water connection and replaced with new water meter. Initially we were getting very less water (10 leters or 20 lts)  now we are not getting even a drop of water. We complained several times to wallman.

Ambedkar Nagar  Whitefield saw a series of road digging around 8 months back. The roads were completely dug and left like that. Now there exist no road in the entire colony of Ambedkar Nagar.

Serenity Layout near Hegde Nagar Bangalore North Zone has No proper Sewage Drain facility  No Garbage disposal facility  No Roads  No Drinking water   No street lights from past 10 years. In the recent past around 3 months back BBMP & KRIDL has sanctioned a project work from HEGDE NAGAR to K.NARAYANAPURA MAIN ROAD which passes through my layout for RAIN Water drain facility which was not very important as of now in this area since ours is not a low level area with Flood issues. The workers have cut down trees  dug up all the rain water drain which was already existing by damaging private property compound walls & BESCOM Electricity wires  BSNL Telephone wires  Bore-well water connections etc.  which has caused very inconvenience & discomfort to the residence of this area. My point here is WHY don\'t BBMP & KRIDL put together focus on projects which are really CRITICAL & useful to public like Sewage  Drinking Water  Road  Sanitation etc.  rather than wasting Money  Manpower  Time & Effort on Non-Critical issues like one mentioned above. I have spoken to all possible officials of both BBMP & KRIDL regarding the same but ended up in going in rounds and rounds explaining the same to all of them with no OUTCOME or proper VALID answer. I am not even sure if this digging up work was planned & approved as per guideline because nobody has a letter or blue print plan copy to justify. Kindly would request the concerned dept to take ownership & responsibility in addressing my complaint asap.,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Odour  foul smell  from drains,Sweeping of road

The road in front of K.R Puram railway station is congested due to heavy traffic  bus stops  and people crossing the road. The situation becomes ugly when a train arrives at K.R Puram station.

This area  is too overcrowded with people. All the buses/taxis/autos/many private vehicles stop here to collect people  making walking in this area extremely dangerous.

We (Sobha Lavender apartments) had applied for Cauvery water connection in 2008. The applicable fees had also been paid as per the revised norms. However  there has been no sign of the water supply so far. Just now there is some news of this connection being serviced. We are being asked to pay for a service connection line (4 inch dia)  from the feeder line (1 foot dia) to our property. Since the BWSSB has not laid the feeder line under our road  we are being told that we need to pay for the service connection from the feeder line which is at a disctance of more than 100 metres. !! This is 6 to 10 times more than what every other apartment building is required to pay for. Is it not the responsibility of BWSSB to lay the feeder line(1 foot dia) along every road ?

It was shocking to here that the state Govt has decided to demolish the land mark building of BALABROOIE GUEST HOUSE to build MLAs Club.  When ciitzens of other ciites like Mumbai  Delhi and Kolkata take pride in preserving the age old monuments which are a symbol of our earlier architecture  here we have a Govt which wants to demolish for the sake of MLAs to relax and enjoy. What a shame. The present Govts and the elected reprsentatives have no concern for such buildings which speak a lot about our art and architechture. They think the Heritage strucutures do not have the Glass and glitzy facade of modern buildings. But the beauty of those cannot be recreated once demoished.

Dear Sir  \n\nI am writing this letter to your notice the bad condition of the 1st lane. For the last four months the road has been almost impassable. We have made several complaints. But the road has been neglected for a long time. The surface of the road is broken by the heavy rains. There are heaps of road metal on both sides of the road. They leave only little room in the middle. The side rains are blocked and the water flows out slowly. So the road get flooded even after a slight rain. There are potholes on the road. The broken culvert is also a danger for vehicles especially at night. This road serves a large number of houses in this area. There is a lot of traffic along the road at any time of the day. So we are grateful to you if you take action to repair the road. \n\nSincerely  \nRaghavendra K P\n\nAdresss\n\n242 srinivas nilaya  opposite to enes factory  8th mile stone  1st cross  vidyanagar  ward no 39 chokkasandra bangalore 560057,Bad patches potholes on roads,Repairs re-surfacing of roads footpaths,Bad Patches

Yes true that BBMP has found a new way of collecting garbage  it\'s just they collect it from road to road and home to home and making people think that they are doing there job great.\nBut what they are up to is that they are collecting it from one side and dumping it on the other side and it has piled up for a week more and no one care to give a look at the issue though there is a continuous follow up made to the BBMP officer and the worst part is when the workers are coming to dump it and when we are opposing it they abuse us and just leave as though they are hired for doing the job in such a nasty way.\nKindly clean up the mess as people residing near to those empty sites are not able to breathe fresh air and not even able to step out from there residence.....,Providing removing replacing dustbins,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Collection point not attended properly

Given that this stretch is used by all vehicles to avoid the half km of non existent road on the main Suranjandas road side  it leads to long traffic jams as the width of the hospital road is no more than 15 ft! Post yesterdays complaint to the Bimanagar traffic police the caved in road has been filled up with earth which has started sinking in due to the rains. It is imperative that this be addressed at the earliest as there is a deep open drain on the other side and high risk of fatal accidents.,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain",Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation

** Adding on behalf of Peenya Industry commuters **\n\nPeenya Industry Metro Station: On stepping outside the metro station  hundreds of meters of steel barricades exist  (and no pavements exist)  \nmaking it extremely cumbersome for pedestrians to cross the road.... A one k.m. walk is needed  given the present setup  just to get \nacross the road.\n\nAction Needed: \nA sub-way/pedestrian crossing solution is needed for pedestrians to cross.\n\nNote: \n 1.

This seems to be a perennial problem in Koramangala. People stopping at the signals on the other side of the road and blocking the on coming traffic. What is surprising is that the traffic police does NOTHING about it. What right do these people have? The main offenders are bikes and taxis with a splattering of private vehicles and sometimes even a police van. What is the traffic police there for? Why are they not  either sending these vehicles back to join the regular flow or fining them for traffic violations? Are these people special because they are taxis and 2 wheelers? Do they have seperate rules for them? One of the main reasons for traffic chaos in this city is because the police do not fine people violating rules because they are BUSY checking for documents and collecting fines rather than directing traffic. As per the rules and a statement made by the traffic police department  the no traffic police is not supposed to stop vehicles for checking documents unless they have broken a rule. But who listens to them when they themselves break all rules!!! \nThe attached image was taken this afternoon at the signal near Ooty Chocolate on 8th Main Road  4th Block  Koramangala.\nWILL THE TRAFFIC POLICE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SO THAT THERE IS SOME ORDER IN THIS CHAOTIC CITY???,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

On the righside of the entrance it is a huge heap of soil  and on the left side truck and autos are parked that are used for garbage collection. The garbage collected from the near by localities are being dumped at VR Layout entrance and then transferred to the trucks. This is creating a traffic menace and un-hygenic environment to all the residents. The school children and office goers are literally struggling to pass through.

This is the third time i have submitted. I have paid up-to date taxes Application No:812417806 Receipt No:1516812417806.\n\nI have visited the office atleast 10 times  every time i visit they tell us to meet some officer who wont be available in office. The officer who initially worked on my application was Puneeth  he has sent the application to RO officer Narayansway. As per the norms Khatha transfer has to be completed by 7 days  but it has been a month  Today also i visited BBMP office  the officer told me it has been sent to head office(RR Nagar). Its actually frustating to get a small work done in BBMP office  without paying a bribe.

This is regarding the perpetually growing traffic problem in front of Manyata Tech Park. The road leading to the Nagawara Signal is not just pothole filled but also has no functional footpaths(pavements). Multitudes of pedestrians from Manyata Tech Park and others find themselves having to walk on the road as a result of this. To top it all  there are several cars and bikes parking themselves unauthorized in front of the restaurants such as Biryani House and others. The pedestrians in an effort to circumvent this  walk on the roads creating further blockage. This reaches painful heights during the rains. Every day several vehicles narrowly escape what could possibly be grievous injuries.    Recommended Solution:     This is a request to BBMP â€“ Corporator  Sub-inspector-Traffic and MLA to fix the pavements outside Manyata Tech Park where 1.35 Lakh people work for our city. Below are the solutions recommended:    1. Clear all encroachments  2. Lay the payments from Manyata Tech Park Gates to Nagavara Circle  3. Not allow unallocated parking near restaurants such as Biryani House and others  4. Not allow buildings nearby to encroach our pavements  5. Fix the potholes on the road from Manyata Tech Park to Nagavara Circle  6. For traffic taking coming from Manyata and taking U-Turn at Nagavara Circle to go towards Hebbal â€“  Break open and make way under the Flyover so that traffic smoothly flows.   7. Lay to Service Road from Nagavar Circle to BEL Office â€“ this will help ease a lot of traffic that is unduly stopping to pick up people on ring road    Looking forward to response from BBMP â€“ Corporator  Sub-inspector-Traffic and MLA.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain"

The silt and dirt from  drainages in  MTS Colony  opp. Vijaya Hospital T. Dasaralli  Bangalore-57 were removed and placed on the roads about a month back. There was no effort to remove it from there.  Now this dirt has spread on the roads and partly fallen again into the drains blocking the flow of sewage water.  The filth from this drain is now flowing on to the road.\n\nMoreover the drainage work that started about 5 years back is still incomplete.  The MLA comes and inaugrates  the digging of a drain .  This is for a stretch of about 50 metres.   Then after 6 months he again comes to inagaurate the digging of drains on the opposite side of the same road.\nThere has been more of inaugrations than  actual work.

BBMP has given permission to construct several apartments in Tubarahalli next to Kundalahalli gate signal without proper commutable road. Two famous schools are functioning beside this road. As per BBMP  this is not a public road. Residents of this road & school goers have protested (Satyagraha) in 2013 & BBMP assured us in writing that this road work will start in Oct 2013 & complete within Dec 2013. Even corporator (Mr Sreedhar reddy-Ward No.85 Doddanekkundi)& MLA(Arvind Limbavali) inaugurated the road in Nov 2013 & assured that the road with drainage & street lights will be completed within 4-6 months. But till now the road work is not completed. Many private landlords are claiming that portion of the road is not public property & is their property. 4-5 notice boards have come up claiming that land is their property & obstructing the road work. It is the BBMP & Govt responsibility to aqquire the land & construct the road for public use as there is no other approach road for the residents to go to the main road. We have given memorandum to Cheif minister  MLA  MP  corporator  BBMP joint commissioner  Mahadevpura long back. But only false assurances  no progress.\nPortion of the road was tarred in January 1st week  2015. The road work was approved for an estimated cost of Rs 1.5Crores. Drainage work was also incomplete. Only half the road has street lights. Many are not working.How BBMP & politicians are not providing the basic infrastructure to the residents here & we are all paying property tax on time to BBMP. Without basic amenities  why we should pay Tax to govt? I am requesting you to get the proper road with drainage & street light as early as possible.

"BACKGROUND and SITUATION:\nThe venue is a Y-shape junction  where vehicles of all sizes arrive. The vehicles usually go in either left  or right  in a \""free-for-all\"" manner. As seen in the pictures motorists wait at the intersection of the junction  to get across  thereby blocking other vehicles that could cross. This results in a jam  or grid-lock. This jam occurs very frequently  multiple times a day  especially when the traffic is more. I have seen a police-man help direct traffic during the evening peak hours. This helps.\n\nHowever  should the police-man not be there at this junction  say during a rain-storm  then the traffic situation at this junction is a complete mess.\n\nThe root cause of this grid-lock  in my opinion  is two-fold: \n1. Systemic (no one knows who has right of way)  and \n2. Behaviour (lack of courtesy to other drivers  and pedestrians) by the motorists.\n\nAbout five pictures of the symptoms are attached.\n\nACTION REQUESTED:\nAs seen in the attached diagram  I am proposing the following  be tried as a pilot solution:\n1. Paint a hatched-line \""No waiting\"" or \""Keep Clear\"" area on the intersection. (I recall seeing such a thing at Minsk square a few years ago). I believe these are usually are yellow in colour. A pictorial symbol of \""No waiting\"" will be helpful since not everyone maybe able to read a certain language. A clear \""STOP\"" line also needs to be marked.\n2. There are few buildings with blank walls at the intersecion. My recommendation is \""STOP\"" symbols be painted on all  three walls  with the following INTERSECTION COURTESY/RIGHT OF WAY RULE FOR MOTORISTS can be written below  preferably in PICTURE form  in a manner that the symbol and rules are clearly visible to drivers arriving from all three sides:\n a) Give way to pedestrians (who have first right of way)\n b) Motorist coming to intersection first has right of way\n c) If two motorists come to the intersection at the same time  the it is the motorist on the left who gets right of way\n d) If three motorists come to the intersection at the same time  courtesy pays... let one go first  and then the  motorist on the left etc. \n\nOnce such a system is put in place  a police-person could still be there to facilitate  and educate the people. Hopefully  the police-person\'s job will be a little easier once these are in place.\n\nNote: The courtesy rules may need to be illuminated in order to be visible in poor light conditions.\n\nBENEFIT:\n* A pilot system in place.\n* Traffic rules for this intersection clear to drivers  and pedestrians.\n* Hopefully  a smoother flow of traffic \n* Life is a little easier for the police-person  and also for pedestrians and drivers.\n\nBased on the outcome of this  if successful  such methods could be piloted for many other similar intersections in Bangalore also.",Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain"

Any buses in that route are crowded. Not just yelahanka buses. Instead of running the buses to majestic empty  they can put more in this route. The timings are rarely followed.\n\nTwo  if there is any other bus in the same route like 401R  401K..these 401B and them start racing..god knows why.\nThey don\'t stop and skip like 3 to 4 stops in a row.\n\nThey don\'t stop near the bus stand and stop in the middle of the road.

I want to bring to your notice the rampant robbery of  Mobile Phones in the BMTC buses which is very prevalent now-a-days. I am also a victim. My phone was robbed by a petty thief on 20th April 2015. I immediately contacted the police of Mahadevpura Police Station Bangalore and tried to file an FIR.  But instead I got a receipt of complaint regarding 'Loss of phone'  and not 'Theft of phone'.The policeman forced me to file the complaint as 'Loss of phone'.  I have seen cases like mine on the rise these days. I do not feel safe in this city because there is rampant rise of the criminals and the police are not doing their duty. The police have a 'laid-back-attitude' towards the rising crime rate and the grievances of the citizens of Bangalore.

Air pollution in and around Kundalahalli  Whitefield is aggravated by presence of Graphite India. While the company may have taken measures to reduce the pollution levels  it still largely contributes to making Whitefield a pollution hotspot. Children especially are the victims- they suffer from respiratory problems from the time they are toddlers. As a mother  their ill-health gives me sleepless nights. Just visit the RXDX clinic located opposite to Graphite India and you know what I am talking about. The air in the clinic is loaded with the pollution emanating from Graphite India and one comes out feeling irritation in the throat  coughing or sneezing.

Ref: Ward: Dasarahalli Zone  Shettihalli Ward & Ward Number: 12 It has recently come to my attention that illegal construction is happened next my home. I live in #53  10th cross  Sapthagiri Layout  Chikkasandra  Bangalore-560057 next to my building  A Complex has been constructed and would like to lodge a complaint with the unsightly and unlawful building that has been getting constructed by violation of the law on the above premises by Mr.Venkatesh. The perpetrator of this illegal construction is Mr.Venkatesh who is extremely rude and hostile to me when I voiced my objection on the above construction. As per the permits in our area  once can construct a building max up to 2 or 2 and half floors. But this building is constructed 6 and half floors and one should leave an open space of 3 feet on all 4 sides of the building which is not there and the space left is less than half a feet. This building I has been constructed by occupying close to my wall even without half a feet and I am sure that this is not the approved plan sanctioned by BBMP. I hope you can spare some personnel to deal with this act of blatant lawlessness as soon as possible. Kindly take immediate action on this  which should be a lesson for others.

I live opposite to Bhuvaneswarinagar park 3rd main road  Banashankari 3rd stage  5th block  right opposite to my house there are street cart vegetable vendors who have positioned their shops right on the footpath blocking the pedestrian\'s right of walking on the footpath. This in turn is forcing the pedestrian\'s to walk on the street which is endangering their lives with risk of being involved in an accident by the vehicle\'s passing through this street.\n\nMoreover this is also creating an parking menace and people who come down to buy vegetables from these street cart vendors park their vehicles right in front of our house gates blocking us from taking out vehicles out of our house and also traffic on this small road has increased due to this. This is disturbing the peace of senior citizens in this locality. \n\nI also have seen a few months ago when BBMP team went on a breaking spree in our area trying to force legitimate shopkeepers from removing their selling articles placed in front of their shops and also breaking their over head plastic roofs which was extending outside their shops. This is much appreciated  but not sure why did they not also vacate these street vendors in front of our house. \n\nThis is not only creating a menace to us  but also to other fellow citizens whose lives are endangered as they cannot walk on this street. I urge BBMP to clear these street vendors from here and respect the fellow senior citizens right of peace.,Proper electric supply to municipal properties,Major repairs to municipal property,Minor repairs to municipal property

Itâ€™s been almost 6 months since BWSSB has dugged out the Ejipura 20th C Cross road to lay sewage pipelines and nothing has been done apart from covering it with mud. It was terrible for the next few months to use that road  due to rain it was totally non-usable. Now  summer is here and I was hoping either BWSSB or BBMP will fix it(there was an agreement between BWSSB and BBMP that BBMP will fix the roads dugged out by BWSSB for lying of sewage pipelines). If the grossly mud was the problem during rains  it\'s now dust during summer. You must understand a large part of pollution is not caused only by vehicles  but by the dust which severely effects one\'s health. I request the concerned authority to look into this matter and fix the road ASAP. It is not only the matter of convenience but also of health of the people residing around.\n\nThanks\nNishanth Kesavan,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property

Gradually  the layouts which don't have proper underground drainage systems have started using this Storm water Drain to connect their  Sewages  knowing very well that is illegal to do the same. Further due to this   the surroundings  have already started  bad smell/odour  and  breeding ground for  mosquitoes  which would lead to health hazard.,Drainage chokes and blockages,Shortage of water supply,Leaks in water lines

The 4th cross-CMH road intersection between the Indiranagar Metro station and Cafe Coffee Day is one of the most dangerous intersections for pedestrians. There is hardly any space for them to walk  with a number of two wheelers being parked beside Cafe coffee day entrance and two way traffic movement in that narrow 4th cross lane.\n\nAlso  not all the showrooms and shops on this lane behind the metro station and coffee day have basement parking. Wonder how the BBMP has been giving permissions for commercial establishments to open without basement parking for these enterprises. Then there are street vendors too  blocking pedestrian movement in this lane near the Metro station.\n\nWhy can\'t this narrow lane be made one way with one side parking and that too a little away from the metro station  so that there is some solace for the pedestrians?\n\nThere have been so many tweets and complaints regarding this lane  yet no action has been taken. There is a limit to everything and a few residents have been contemplating filing a PIL if no action is taken in this regard.\n\nI hope the concerned authorities will look into this problem at the earliest.,Drainage chokes and blockages,Unauthorised construction development,Major repairs to municipal property

Hi BTP   I'm Dr Ram Badari  a general surgeon. I have always noticed that ambulances get stuck in traffic and the culprits are the people outside the ambulance who really don't value others life.

In this process there will be documentary evidence of the people trying to obstruct work of the ambulance and necessary fine or social service by those obstructing can be done. It will be revolutionary step if taken now.

My netconnect number: 7483163551 was cancelled in the month of Jan-2014 because of the all the wrong and false information from the Reliance customer care. They made me to pay excess of Rs. 1500/1600 for activation of 3 months advance rental plan which was suppose to be Rs. 1000/- advance rental plan  and didn\'t activated but they were insisting me to pay more. So I denied and cancelled the connection  hence Reliance had to pay me back Rs.1100/- back after all the deduction they made and they said it will take 45 days to refund the amount. So I contacted the customer care after 45 days and customer care people denied to provide information on the cancelled connection and suggested to visit store. As suggested I visited Yelahanka New Town stores  where they said they also don\'t have information about the refund amount and said it will normally take 90 days and asked me to wait till April end. As suggested I waited till April end but no refund happened. Hence I visited their store again in May 1st week and they were renovating the store so told to visit some other time due to maintenance issue. So I visited today and still the store is renovating but they had a step up of store in the same building garage space. I went their and asked about the details and they said to contact customer care  which I did in front of them but it was no response from customer care and call went on hold for more then 25mins. So again I started to ask about the next escalation metrics where I can get the solution instead of visiting stores or calling customer care. They started saying they do not have any other solutions and they said they don\'t care about this issues and all. So an argument started between us and store owner came in and started threatening that he will beat me up in front of my mother  they even said that they will close the shutter and beat me up  so my mother got anxious and we had to leave the place as they were 3 people started abusing us and tried to hit also. But due to few other peoples interference they couldn\'t do anything  I even tried to take video of their rude attitude and misbehavior but couldn\'t.

There is no proper garbage collection happening in 2nd Main  3rd Cross Road and surrounding areas. Garbage Collection Van does not come regularly and when they come and you go to give the garbage bag that time they demand money. I have complained about this several times but nothing has been done so far. As a result people throwing garbage on the streets  vacant plots and that attracts dog big time. Request concerned authority to take this matter seriously and give us a resolution.,Collection point not attended properly,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point
There is no garbage collector around park (Bavi park aka Bridavana) 7 th main road 4th block Jayanagar. We used to have one but she stopped coming.

Please sort this mess out.

Marathahalli residential areas (Ward No 86) have almost become a living hell. Why so? It is because the residents here are staring at death traps on roads. Loose gravel scattered around due to frequent  movement of water tankers and school buses on these roads pose a threat to smaller vehicles and the thick clouds of dust are suffocating.  The rain and the deep potholes it has formed on the residential roads give us the jitters. Because of continuous rains thick slippery slush coats the roads  making it almost impossible to walk or ride 2 wheelers (see few photos attached herewith). The downpour has only worsened the condition. Residents here are tired of complaining to the civic authorities to asphalt the roads which has not been done for the past many years now.  Numerous complaints to BBMP have only fallen on deaf ears. Why  cannot BBMP attends to civic woes on time? Why do they wait for accidents and deaths to happen to wake up?,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain",Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation

There is too much garbage lying on Thulasi Theatre road. This is the main feeder road to ORR as Marthahalli junction has no right turn from old airport road to ORR. On a daily basis IT professionals cross the road and see huge amount of garbage pied up. The shops on this road do not have a proper garbage disposal place and all the food joints are using this place to dump their garbage. This is a menace as it breeds mosquitoes  makes the road unhygienic and produces stink which is unmanageable. The garbage collection vehicles seem to be avoiding this place or maybe they are doing but garbage is just too to handle.,Sweeping of road,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point

The railway gate just before the Kengeri railway station  also known as Dubasipalya railway gate is a nightmare for commuters  especially during peak office hours. The train frequency have increased too now. The core issue is  the gate is closed 5 minutes before the arrival of train and worst case if train is going towards Mysore  we have to wait for good 15-20 minutes because  unless the train reaches the station the guard doesn\'t open the gates. If there is another train coming in opposite direction  atleast 30 mins is wasted here. During which the traffic piles upto Mysore road and interior roads which are narrow.

By the time entire metro is ready  looks like most of the ppl who are facing issues would retire :)\n\nJust by my rough calculation  it seems like the train starting from YPR can reach WFD within 40 mins.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

While going towards BTM from HSR  on the HSR signal there is a service road which is meant to be used by vehicles going towards EC. On this service road there is a small opening to connect back to the road which goes towards BTM  due to this opening there is usually a huge traffic pile up since people want to take a right to connect back to the main road. It would be good if that opening is closed and that the service road is used only for vehicles going towards EC which will help in reducing the congestion at that point.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

1. There is no new BSNL connections  FIBRE NET  new broadband connections available in the area since a long time. All the concerned authority blames it on the BDA for not permitting. This is a very serious issue as lots of people who have relocating their houses to this area are seen surrendering their BSNL landlines and are very bothered about to find a internet connection. Even top class network providers like BSNL and Airtel doesn\'t have its feasibility in majority of the area. All the corresponding authorities blames the BDA who are delaying for permissions. A very underdeveloped area when it comes to telecom sectors. \n2. Garbage issues : There are a lot of garbage issues in the area. There is a garbage truck standing near 13th main  2nd stage. That is a dumping point for all BBMP to dump the locality\'s garbage. That stretch of road is unbearable to walk around because of a very bad odour  unhygienic environment  ad during rain the place becomes a nightmare.

It is causing lots of problems to the senior citizens living in that house as they cannot go out of the house as the entrance is blocked with mud. Just imagine for past 1 year and half the mud is kept like that only and the BBMP contractor who had laid the pipes didn\'t even bother to remove this mud. Pl note that this complaint was raised by myself several times but no action had been taken on this. This is the 21st time I am raising the same complaint. But I will not leave unless this complaint is resolved.

Doddenekundi 13th cross  Pragathi layout Cattle on the untarred street by the local milkmen who keep the area very dirty. You can see the cattle excreta spread over and collections lying everywhere for long times without disposal. These get dispersed when it rains. There is a continuous smell of cow dung. There is a continuous flow of cowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s urine. a. Health hazards associated: Leptospirosis  bovine tuberculosis  brucellosis  etc. b. Fly population would increase and they may spread number of communicable diseases c. Breeding of mosquitoes-We cannot keep the door or windows open in the day or night due to the mosquitoes d. Since the road is already untarred and is a mud road it makes it more difficult to walk or drive a vehicle in the evening without stamping on the cowdung and urine since the cowdung and urine is all over the road. Suggestions: Why cant these cattle be kept in a confined area with proper hygienic conditions provided. They are supposed to be kept inside the ownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s residences and not on the road or in the conservancy. Providing protective covers to the cattle so that the excreta do not contaminate the surroundings. This requires strict and proper legislative action.

Why BMTC bus conductors are not willing to give change at the moment when the commuters give money?..\nI board on to a bus from Ramamurthinagar to Marathahalli and I gave 100 rupees.So he had to give me 80 rupees as balance. The conductor didn\'t write any thing on the back of the ticket and I asked the balance twice on the way to marathahalli n he just went away as if he has no change with him. At last when i had to get down at my last stop  ie  Marathahalli I asked again n he pretends that he\'s very busy in writing some thing in his book. He gave me the balance only when i asked loudly second time as i was about to fight with him. And I saw a bunch of ten rupees notes with him.\nThey are fraudsters and trying to take the money by checking the travellers\' memory to ask the balance amount. In many cases the travellers may forget the balance as the city dwellers are busy and tensed with their job n life. So these conductors are taking advantage of it. \nMy suggestion to this problem is simple but to implement a machine by which it can print the ticket mentioning the place a commuter boarding n getting down. So the travellers and checkers can know exactly fro where to where a person is travelling n how much the charge too. And if some thing to be implemented in an advanced method  we can implement swipe cards in the buses. Some of the private buses in Kerala implemented it and successful too.\n\nSecond problem is that  what\'s the criteria use to calculate the bus fare?..\nIt\'s really unreasonable to givr more money for the short distances and less money for the long distances especially when BMTC has no proper services through routes and travellers are compelled to board on to different buse too. \nFro example  if I travel to domlur from Ramamurthi nagar  i have to board in to three buses but the distance is less than 11 kms.\nSo first i have tpay5 rupees to reach ITI gate n then 17 to Binnamangala and again 11 rupees to domlur. So 34 rupees to travel 11 kms. Is it reasonable?...\nThird problem is about the ratio of ordinary buses to the volvo buses.\nBMTC is compelling the majority of poor and middle class people to pay more by allocating more volvo buse in some routes by reducing the number of ordinary buses. This can be seen in marathahalli  silkboard n hebbal routes. And many of the buses are running empty too.\nOnce i travelled to airport in a volvo and i was the only one in the bus as a traveller to airport at night. \nAgain in some routes we can see that there will not be any buses for a long time ie  1 hour etc and we can see two or three buses are coming continuously. Except the first bus other buses will be running empty too. \nAnd finally all the effect of this mismanagement is on the shoulder of daily commuters by not willing to reduce the ticket charge even though the diesel price has come down considerably. This will create the city traffic also to a worst condition because all people will prefer to travel by their own vehicle. So it result in endless traffic trouble in Bangalore.\nIs it called as public transport for the benefit of public?..\nAnd who is benefiting out of this corrupted system?..,Minor repairs to municipal property,Drainage chokes and blockages,Person falling in Manhole

Dear Team  I must thank Mr. Khan from BBMP who had taken some time to visit the place and advised the concern to remove the debris dumped on the road which was lying from months and also it has been removed now. But the main purpose on improving the road condition and make it smooth motorable condition is not solved  as the problem is clashing between two departments i.e. BBMP and BWSSB  since BWSSB had dugged up the road for sanitary works. Our concern is how long this process goes on and when we will get the good road  although if BWSSB takes up the work they don\'t bother to complete the task and clear the road on time (Please find attached photo which is self explanatory). Any lay man understand it does not take years to complete the asphalt road  only thing our government officials should take it up seriously.

The road around this small roundabout has been further degrading for the last four months. Several accidents have taken place due to this bad stretch of road. It has become a bottleneck as traffic has to slow down almost to a halt.

Respected sir/madam  Too many times i\'ve witnessed people getting chased  barked at  attacked at  followed by and ganged upon by dogs. I have had my own share of experiences here  so much so that i have successfully developed a phobia of stray dogs  and tried getting over it.. Only to end up with high anxiety issues upon seeing a dog looking at me. The number of times i\'ve entered my colony members\' homes at late evening or whenever a dog barked at me for no reason  is simply too high. I have stopped going out or returning in the evenings cause in the dark they blindly chase people. I also understood that there are men who drive way too fast inside the colony and drift sometimes  this scares all the dogs and as a result  they noe chase Every Single white coloured car. Know why? Because they somehow remember. I mean  even one or two stray dogs are manageable but here..we currently have minimum of 6 dogs at every turning. So they will come running even if one dog barks at a person or vehicle. I would really like to make an honest request to you  to please see to it that the colony is not dominated by dogs  to let the children play outside as they avoid doing so today because if the stray dogs. Its horrendous to walk on the roads seeing so many dogs keeping an eye on you. Its also terribly sad that that i have to slow down just so that the dofs dont misunderstand my urgency to catch my bus to college! I waste time in waiting for their fights to get over or for someone to come along so that i could walk with them. There seems to be no end in migrations of these dogs from one place to another.. So its a humble request and prioritized necessity that we get rid of these excess of stray dogs here  so that for once  i dont have to earn every dog\'s trust as i leave for the bus stop and can walk around my colony even in the evenings or early mornings. After all   neither are they happy nor the people.. And as we all know  too much is always too bad. Thank you!,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Sweeping of road

The  roads in Panathur new extension ( in Varthur ward ) are in bad shape. Each time it rains it becomes difficult to even walk.So many people skid and fall on daily basis due to bad roads.\nThe drainage also is non existent.

Is this why our parents tell us that if we have any problem we have to inform the police? when the police officers just wanted to have fun.

This is not the first time  I am raising issue regarding garbage collection on halasahalli road. The garbage is not collected regularly. Because of this  the garbage gets piled up. The stray dogs pull the garbage on to the roads and cause havoc. Because of this there are more mosquitoes and also there is lack of cleanliness in the surroundings. \n\nPreviously too i rised complaint. At that time as a resolution i was asked to talk with the contractor who is responsible for garbage collection. He says that he was awarded contract in 2007 when there are very few houses. Now  he says there are too many houses and the contract is not getting renewed for him to invest more in garbage collection. This is the state one year back. \n\nNow  the houses are even more.

A big number of transgenders operate between the stretch of Hosa Road junction  Electronic city junction  Electronic city elevated fly over entrance bus stop and Nice road exit to Electronic city. These are causing great problems for people commuting by 2 wheeler or in auto rickshaws. The commuters in car are also not spared as the transgenders sometimes spit on the glass window when their nuisance is not entertained by the car owner. These are not beggars  they are robbers who demand money and unnecessarily touch both men and women alike in strange  discomforting and very annoying ways. Traffic cops are mute spectators and sometimes even enjoy an odd laugh looking at the situation of an ongoing harassment situation like this. I have also experienced intolerable vulgur gestures where they try to lick the person by tongue or even spit on the motorbike. No one wants this. Why do the traffic cops not disperse these maniacs with such anti social behavior? I think it\'s only a matter of time before our patience boils out and we ourselves start handling such perverts who misbehave in public (especially with our fellow female co-citizens),Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Minor repairs to municipal property

Every year the Sewage line on the road gets clogged and begins to overflow. The pipes are old and the flow is against the gravity  due to which the sewage is back flowing and hence foul smell emanates from the sewage lines inside the houses. Solution is lay the pipes properly and ensure it flows by gravity  and that the broken pipes are replaced  such that mud and other wastes will not enter the pipes and clog it.,Drainage chokes and blockages,Overflowing drains or manholes,Odour  foul smell  from drains
Most vehicles  especially autos  2 wheelers   taxis etc cut into the next lane all of a sudden without any signal  cut across roads  start driving slowly in front of vehicles after changing lanes  speak on mobile phones(all vehicles)  drive with blinding high beam headlights etc. Traffic police MUST penalise drivers severely and more CONSISTENTLY through the day. Very few locations do this between 10-1 and maybe 6-7. It\'s a rare sight in namma Bengaluru. Traffic flow is smoother and will reduce accidents  if you just fine drivers for lane cutting violation alone. Thank you.

A steep rise in the mosquito population is noticed since the  last 45 days. We also realised that we have NEVER seen any fumigation on / off church Street in the last 2 years. Request the authorities / BBMP health inspector to warn the vendor to immediately and  order fumigation especially in this monsoon season. Also to warn the owners of a large empty plot next to Ghar apartments - M/S Skylark builders  to fumigate as there is stagnant water and uncontrolled wild vegetation growth.

The Hennur Main Road is riddled with deep pot holes.  This road is extensively used  but lacks street lighting  and has very serious potholes.  Things are made worst by digging the sides for drainage  which is an ever lasting programme.  One side of the road is partially done recently  but the sewage people have dug the newly done road at least in two places.  these area will not be covered again until the next tarring programme comes. A portion of this new road is showing the sign of developing pot holes again.  Will this problem be ever solved  I am justified in questioning this by experience.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages

Dear Sir \n\nI being a sufferer of a public nuisance am helpless to report an issue which is causing serious threat to my and my families\'s health on a regular basis and which is not taken care of seriously till now.\n\nAt 4:00 AM everyday  they start their business and is breaking down my and my familiy\'s health - gradually raising serious health problems.\n\nI am taking about VMR Granites large granite cutting factory just beside my apartment in Vandana Earls Court in Kudlu Main Road  behind VGP Layout. The amount of noise the factory produces is tremendous. And I am sure you would not have wanted such a huge noisy environment beside your family  especially if youhave children and parents. It is posing serious threat due to the following:\n\nAs per the directions provided by KSPCB  they were asked to build extra walls and the entrance facing away from the apartments. Also  they were asked to operate 10 - 12 hours daily.\n\nHowever  they are violating the norms without any heed to the authorities  and breaking the peace of silence of sleep as early as 4:00 AM morning every day. I have even proof of their working procedures  whereas they are closing after 10:15 PM. Their normal working hours is approx 19 hours daily.\n\nThis way  I and my helpless parents and siblings are not having proper night\'s sleep and those who stay in the day bear the wrath of noise.\n\nThis is a common problem which is faced by my fellow apartment owners as well.\n\nRequest you to please deal with this and help us out.,Pollution due to chemical effluents,Air pollution,Running without licence

The layout right next to GR Tech park on ITPL Whitefield Main Road has been living with a Mud Road for more than 8 years. Lately  one of the roads was tarred half way and the rest of the road along with the cross roads were left as is.There are big potholes  stones  heaps of debris and loose mud lying everywhere on the roads. The whole area is uneven. Nothing has been done to fix these issues in the last years. The road is left in a more worse condition after any repair work/ digging is done. These areas seem like orphaned areas with no one to care about the basic civic necessities of a decent road. Forget the elderly and children  NO ONE can walk on these roads. There is continuous traffic on these roads that makes the atmosphere very dusty and dangerous. There are no footpaths  no trees.

The KH Road to Richmond road flyover (perhaps the oldest flyover in Bangalore) has a divider that is built with stone/rock. These get constantly broken up by pillions who we assume as night time break it to make a U-turn. This causes a major inconvenience and a potential fatal accident at night times. The traffic on this stretch is enormous and the rocks/stones are some times laid out into the middle of the road. This is very dangerous!,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages
I take an auto everyday from Domlur bridge to EGL main entrance. Everyday I face this problem of Auto drivers demanding unjustified amounts. The distance is just about 1 km and in the last 3 months only one auto driver agreed to go this distance on meter rate. Everyone else demands from 40-60 Rs. Why do they even have a meter in their autos if the dont have to use it. They come up with this baseless argument that they need to take a U turn and come back. How is that justified ? Even I have to walk inside EGL for 1km to reach my workplace. Am i taking money from my company for that ? The main reason why auto drivers have these demands are because people in Bangalore dont think about the money they spent on auto rides. It is we who have spoil their habits. Even though it is Rs 20 only...by the end of the year it all mounts up to atleast 5200/- extra that I pay to auto drivers. Why should we pay this? Why aren\'t there any rules for Auto drivers in Bangalore? Domlur is such an important junction. There should be a police inspector there or atleast prepaid auto stand. This needs to be changed at any cost .,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Repairs re-surfacing of roads footpaths

I have recently moved to Bovi Colony Main Road  opp. turahalli mini forest.  From the days well before I have started constructing my house  garbage like building materials  wastes are being dumped everyday on either side of this road.  Upon asking they are saying its done as per BBMP and they will level it.  I wonder why BBMP would ask to dump building waste on rain water drain  eventually I got to know that these are being done illegally by tractor owners of vicinity.  If someone questions them they say BBMP  if ladies in our household questions them they stare at them in such a way that that they never would ever dare to come out if tractor seen around.  The constant dumping has caused blockage of rain water drainage on both sides of road.  If it rains heavily all the road water enters our home and causes huge problem to clean them.  Please look into the matter and stop all building waste materials  building materials are being dumped on road side.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Sweeping of road

Dear Sir \nI am a daily commuter in the Outer ring road and I travel from Hebbal to Goraguntepalya. daily  I see many traffic violations across the ring road by commuters and the major violoations happens in two places. \n\n1. DeviNagar bus stop after the Big baazar flyover. ( Map location with marking attached)\nHere motorists coming from Devi nagar will cross the road and ride in the opposite direction to us who are coming from big bazaar flyover. The will come in that way for 200- 300 meters to cross the railway track to go to Lottegollahalli or Nagashettihalli. If some one questions them they give a careless look and go away. \nOnce an auto came towards a bus by crossing the road in the opposite direction. He escaped the bus but hit an old couple in a two wheeler who are behind the bus. The old lady got injury to her hand. When questioned the auto driver was answered rude to the old man. When I interviened and asked why did you come in wrong direction he answered \'No..this is the right direction.. i will come in this way only\' I have asked him why don\'t you go little further and take a U turn under the flyover and he replied \'who will go in that way..you want me go that far..no I will go in this way only and this is how I ride\'\nThis is just an example. Not only two wheelers and autos but also cars  mini vans are also go in the same way. I see many parents with their kids coming in that wrong route. I wonder where are the traffic cops. I never see any one on any day but I see at least one minor accident every week.\n\n2. Near Muthyalanagar Bus stop  Gokula Extension  opposite to HP petrol bunk.\n\nHere also  Motorists who comes from MS Ramaiah road and connect ORR at BEL circle near under bridge. From there  to go to Pipeline road one must go little ahead and take U turn near Muthyalanagar bust stop near Petrol Bunk but motorist will cross the road (There is no divider there) and come in the opposite direction. Even school buses  vans  Cars comes in the same route.\nWhen I questioned them they say \'houdu idu wrong route..nanu hige barthini...ninag yakke..hogappa\' (Yes..I know it is a wrong route  but I will come in this way only..why do you bother..go away)\nI see traffic cops in this junction once in a month and stopping them and charging fine  but being a daily menace I don\'t this is not the solution.\n\nI request the traffic cops to close the divider in the above two places with barricade so that every one take a U turn and go.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Minor repairs to municipal property

Hello     My name is Biplab and i am living in Ayyappa Nagar  SM Road  Jallahalli West  Bangalore - 560015.    The roads in Ayyappa Nagar are in very pathetic condition. Many times road construction people came and did temporary repair but it never lasts for more than one week. It becomes a big mess in rain for both vehicles and pedestrians. Day by day the condition is becoming more worst. There are so many potholes and the road is in very bad condition.      Not only this  there is no proper garbage keeping facility also.

No doubt that BBMP people are doing there work efficiently  every morning people comes to take the garbage but till evening the roads becomes full of garbages. There are concrete chairs to the road sides but we can not sit there because of the garbages thrown on the road and can't even walk properly on the street.

The corner of the Cambridge yard near HOPCOMS has become a dumping yard for the ward 89. In spite of speaking to Mr chandrappa of BBMP who was identified for this same complaint through this column a number of times the contractor has made this place a dumping and collection centre. This action has created bottle necks for traffic during peak school  timings  Breeding of mosquitoes  Foul smell and people are not able to walk through this stretch as the half of the road has become filthy and full of garbage. Since this is the main road connecting to Jogupalya  authorities like police and BBMP should ensure that contractor cannot use this important place for his staging work.

There is heavy traffic on Church Road  A. Narayanapura towards KR Puram railway station in the evenings. The road is very narrow and full of pot holes and the traffic coming from Marathahalli towards Hebbal and air port take this narrow route to avoid the traffic jam in front of the railway station. This is a residential area and the road can\'t take this kind of traffic. As the residents of this area  we are not able to take out or park our vehicles or walk on the road. The vehicles plying on this road often overspeed and honk continuously at the slightest provocation. In the night these vehicles will be moving with bright headlights and our children can\'t walk or commute on this road freely. As parents we are now scared about our children and we are continuously living with anxiety and fear.

Hi  t is common everyday on 3rd Main  8th cross road at junction on HSR 14 main cross road to see Cows  Buffalo  ox getting attracted to the garbage and roam in this road including Jakkasandra village roads. These are animals which are to be taken care of by owners or municipality. The animals feed on garbage and shit around all places. Sometimes they enter house compounds to take shelter from rains. When they are not well after feeding on garbage they just fall down and they would lie there till it recovers or die. some times these big animals fight among themselves and damage the property  plants and vehicles around also injure people and children. These animals pose big danger in the vicinity. Request officials concerned to look into the issue and provide relief to residents of Jakkasandra and Venkatapura. Note: The problem is due the garbage dumping  may be if garbage is cleared they animals may not be here. .But Municipality has to give them food at different place.

I live in No.10  1st Main  Samvruddhi Layout  Kumaraswamy Layout 2nd Stage. Next to my house there are 3 vacant sites (Nos. 7  8 and 9) which have become a major dumping ground now. The site owners are very irresponsible to leave their property in such a situation and letting the neighbours face the embarrassment of living with garbage all around. I have been trying hard to get the phone numbers of the site owners but to no avail. If I get the numbers  I would want to them to hire a JCB and get the sites cleaned. They truly are irresponsible citizens. Hence  I am requesting BBMP to kindly help in clearing the garbage from the sites. This is not the first time I am complaining to BBMP  but the fourth time. The BBMP workers bury the garbage which is dangerous. When I asked why they are burying  they say no place to dump. Even after that  some irresponsible citizens still keep throwing the garbage there  a bunch of senseless people. I would also request BBMP to please find the contact numbers of these site owners from their records and give them a stern warning.\nThank You \nA concerned and a worried neighbour,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage lorry not reported for service

Hi there \n\nI live in Vannarpet and the stretch of road (meant to be a walkway) opposite to my house has been a garbage haven for a long while now  attracting cows  goats  dogs  rodents and people who conveniently attend nature\'s calls all round the day. Due to the frequent rains and infrequent garbage cleaning - not only is there foul smell all through the day but is becoming the cause for diseases like Dengue  Cholera and Chikungunya. My main woe is that residents in and around are falling ill frequently and if that is not dangerous enough there recent events of boys using this place as a dope joint and other illicit activities. \n\nKindly  request the team to look into this asap.\n\nThanks\nHema,Collection point not attended properly,Sweeping of road,Silt to be lifted on road

I have even proof of their working procedures  whereas they are closing after 10:15 PM. Their normal working hours is approx 19 hours daily.\n\nThis way  I and my helpless parents and siblings are not having proper night\'s sleep and those who stay in the day bear the wrath of noise.\n\nThis is a common problem which is faced by my fellow apartment owners as well.\n\nRequest you to please deal with this and help us out.,Proper electric supply to municipal properties,Minor repairs to municipal property,Person falling in Manhole

Residents are not able to live peacefully due to the amount of noise created by these shops and it is affecting health of senior citizens and infants. They are also occupying the road and footpath by parking vehicles leaving no space for residents vehicles.

Hi  Garbage is thrown on side of the road next to Shell petrol pump on Basavanagar main Road. 560037. People going to work  maids etc  just throw the garbage here and move on. Garbage van comes in the morning to clear it  but within few hrs again its full. Its so unhygienic. I think people throw garbage here because the door to door collection of it is very poor. If you walk on this road  you will notice garbage dumped at every few yards. Request BBMP to resolve this permanently please and give residents a more healthy environment. \nThanks..,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Collection point not attended properly
After repeated complaints; garbage still remains unattended and heaping. People around the vicinity have no common sense   lack civic sense and dump garbage at a blink of an eye. BBMP needs to penalise the people who dump and stop this as a act of dumping at this corner. The stench from garbage is horrible - why are we so insensitive to others. As the new corporator is being voted in (which i shall also participate in) we require an immediate solution to this - the solution being barricading of this area to avoid garbage dumping - putting up a penalty board  making the footpath walkable. Catch the people who dump by seizing their aadhaar card or so. It is simply ironic as BBMP PEOPLE ALSO DUMP ALL THE GARBAGE here as seen in the photos from their auto. They dump everything from mattresses to Water closets. The BBMP workers also take the debris & muck from other places & fill it on the road as seen in the image again. Mind you even the road is not motorable - it is in a pathetic conditions with certain areas caving in also. Request all citizens of the locality to stand up  and create a commmunity sense and not dump garbage - which applies especially to the BBMP. Lets do one thing why not dump garbage in front of ministers office - will they keep quiet about it??? I keep getting a comment from Henry Robert stating to close the complaint. How can i close it when it is not resolved???,Drainage chokes and blockages,Collection point not attended properly,Silt to be lifted on road
There are so many 401 range buses through the above mentioned routes connecting Yelahanka to other areas via Yeshwanthpur. However  it is all through a single route (except the deviation to Vidyaranyapura and MS Palya). It would be so helpful if some buses are connected to Hebbal via BEL circle. Many professionals work in companies located all through Outer Ring Road. If one has to reach Marathahalli from Doddabettahalli  he has to catch one bus to BEL circle  then another to Hebbal and take another bus from there. It is a long journey and almost an hour is wasted in reaching Hebbal itself. It takes no more than 15 minutes in bike through the GKVK road. But there are no proper parking facilities in Hebbal to take that option. So we have to rely on BMTC services. I hope the concerned authorities find a solution for this.,Mosquito nuisance,Rat nuisance,Fogging
Dear Sir \n\nGovernment spent lakhs of rupees in remodeling the pavements of Dr. Rajkumar Road ( Stretch between Star Bazaar Signal to Navrang signal. They have clearly made space for parking cars and two wheeler on one side from the Star Bazaar to Navrang ( Opp . Suguna Hospital side ). Now the problem is the Police have marked alternate parking days in this stretch. There is no logic behind this because the other side do not have space for parking vehicles and they have to be parked in the road. This will lead to congestion on Tuesdays   Thursdays and Saturdays from Navrang to Star Bazaar side of Dr.Rajkumar Road.I request your team to take up the issue with higher authorities and resolve the same so that we can park our vehicles at the bays provided by the Government and not on the road,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

The enterance/exit to the newly constructed railway underpass at kasturinagar II phase near purvanka midtown  beniganahalli lake which was expected to be a huge relief for the traffic pile up on beniganahalli bridge has itself become a problem. \nThe mouth of the underpass on FCI godown rd side becomes 1 lane from 2 lanes causing a massive bottleneck and stops traffic movement completely during peak hours.\n\nthe issue is due to diversion of the road to the side area which has made this expensive underpass useless defeating the purpose of its construction.\none solution will be to make the ingress and egress lanes at different grades. i.e.  exit lane is lower in height and entry lane is at a higher height giving access both to the underpass as well as the side area.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

We wrote a letter to them with a disclaimer that the flat does indeed have occupants and requested them to reinstate the bills. This was a few months ago.

We have empty plot and open land next to Bellandur Lake  next to our community Mantri Espana in Kariyama Agara  Bellandur near Sakra World Hospital. The open land is taken by rag pickers/slum dwellers. New slums are coming up at fast pace. Our community is surrounded with open defecation  mixed garbage dumped daily and construction debris continuous flow. All this open area is becoming landfill and  slum dwellers colony. Both are growing at fast pace. All slum dwellers defecate in open  pick up all garbage from nearby shops. Sell the scraps that they can and rest of waste is dumped in open mixed with wet waste  coconuts and construction debris. Then there is garbage burning that keeps happening on and off. Construction debris dumping has been reported to BBMP many times along with trailer/tractor numbers but no action has been taken so far. Continuous flow of debris trucks throughout the night cause disturbance. Apart from causing visual distress  these surrounding are becoming health hazard to the community who is following all solid waste management practices on premises including segregation  wet waste composting. The view of cows feeding through mixed waste and eating plastic  stray dogs on garbage piles and small slum dwellers children looking for valuable waste has become a daily sight.We are swamped with flies in our houses and can't open windows. Dumped coconuts are accumulating rain water and becoming breeding grounds for dengue mosquito. Please advise what should be next course of action to  --- get area clean of garbage piles   ---- Stop dumping of garbage --- stop construction debris dumping that is coming from construction at RMZ Ecoworld and other big names ---- Get notice to owner of private land for negligence of his property that is resulting in becoming health hazard for society.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Trade without License,Hawkers

When it rains  it renders this route near unusable  but people still take a chance to avoid the traffic jammed main roads.    Forget about maintenance  we need proper compaction  gravel  and asphalting first.    Why do we need this road built and maintained?    - Keeps a huge amount of traffic off the already choking HAL Airport Road  Marathahalli main road  and the Outer Ring Road.     - Saves commuters a lot of time and agony when plying through the clogged main roads.     - Gives relatively easier passage to reach big establishments such as the Mantri building that houses Flipkart and JDA  Sobha apartments  Sakra hospital  and Bangalore Central  to name just a few.    If you look at the Google Earth screenshot attached  the irony is  that it appears as a legit road on the map  but in reality  doesn't even qualify as a road.    There are more apartment complexes and huge building under construction off the Bellandur lake and this mud road  so everyone can foresee the traffic situation worsening soon.    Appeal to BBMP (and all concerned departments) to take this up on priority and build the road at the earliest.",Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

This is a familiar sight for all commuting on the Bellandur lake road via Yemlur - to be greeted by foul smelling  toxic  frothing sewage.     If it is a windy day  expect to see the froth flying all over  landing on the windshields  like (toxic) snow! Even our curriculum's ensure that our children learn in schools about - H2S  Ammonia  Methane  Monoxides and more toxic or flammable gases - resulting from untreated sewage.    The froth in Yemlur caught fire recently. Citizens expect the authorities to act swiftly enough to prevent a bigger fire or bio-hazard that's clearly waiting to happen.    Why are we living with the lack of basic infrastructure and safety in a tier-1 city like Bangalore?    We must begin with addressing this to be able to save our lakes and underground water resources.    1. Why is this happening?  2. Who are the culprits - local residential complexes without STPs? Industries?   3. Isn't releasing toxic  untreated sewage unlawful?  4. What is the penalty? Are they being levied on defaulters?    Appealing to BWSSB  BBMP  and local residents to address this at the earliest.

Kindly refer my complaint no. W01390C117550. The 2nd Main road at New Tharagupet  right opposite the Central Police Station  adjacent to Minto Eye Hospital and Madhuvan Lodge is not at all motor able because of the bad condition of the road. Several complaints to repair the said road have not been addressed by the BBMP authorities. Are these officers not answerable to their superiors or is it a nexus in the BBMP?\nPart of the road is always covered by the heavy commercial vehicles parked in the no parking zone (in three parallel rows) making the life of the common man miserable. The Central Police Station boasts a huge hoarding inspiring the citizens of Bangalore city to report traffic offences through the PUBLIC EYE application for Android & Apple phones is right opposite to this road. It is beyond my understanding as to why the officers at the Central Police Station do not act on these offenders who are creating this nuisance right opposite to their office.\nThese websites like ichangemy city  public eye & bbmp.sahaya.in are all an eye wash and none of the officers want to do their jobs.

The footpath between 9th cross and Trinity Diagnostic center in JP Nagar 2nd phase  KSRTC Layout  (near 4th Main) is being used as Garbage dumping place for near by residents. And since the footpath is in bad condition and used as garbage bin  lots of public (passers by  auto drivers  cab drivers  and pedestrians) and near by slum dwellers are using the place as public toilet. The footpath is unusable and since many people urinate as well as used it as toilet  the place stinks and we are scared of spread of diseases. It is highly necessary to not only clean and pay a new footpath but also beautify that place so that people don\'t simply continue using that place as toilet. And also there is necessity of Free to use public toilets close by and increase awareness among slum dwellers to use toilets inside their homes instead of roads as its dangerous for people living close by and also to them. The place is becoming so badly unusable because of no authority taking action on this. Not just cleaning the place but keeping it well lit and taking steps that make people embarrass to use the place as toilet is needed.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages,Unauthorised construction development

The Old Madras Road was dug up along the left side while going from Suranjandas Road signal towards KR Puram about an year ago for laying some pipe line . After the pipe line was laid the dug up portion was refilled with loose mud and left without topping up with tar for more than a year now. There is no road at all at the left side where the road takes a left turn towards Biayyappanahalli Metro Station .Same is the case while taking a right turn while coming from the Metro Station into the Old Madras Road. While giving contracts for digging up the road for laying electrical or water or sewarage pipe lines are the contractors not required to restore the road to the original condition by properly refilling the dug up portion  hardening it and then topping it with tar immediately after the work of laying the pipe line is over? Whose job is to oversee this work completion in Bangalore roads where it is a common practice to leave the dug up portion without topping it with tar for months together?,Bad Patches,Unauthorised construction development,Major repairs to municipal property

"Dear Sir \nPlease go through the mail chain below to know the gravity of the situation and take immediate corrective action against DLF and JLL Property Managements firms. Repeated requests for resolution (mail chain below) have gone unheard by DLF/JLL management and it\'s just a matter of time before a major mishap happens and BBMP will have to answer!\nDear Ms Shikha\n\nThis is a really serious matter and a matter of life and death. Solicit your prompt attention in this regard. It is a sensible demand that any expense towards repairing the lift for toruble free operation should be covered under manufacturer warranty. In case manufacturer warranty is over  DSHPL should bear the cost on its head and not pass it on to the Association via JLL.\n\nJust in case you have conflicting thoughts  it is important to note Section 7.3 and 7.4 of Karnataka Ownership of Flats Act  1972.\n\nhttp://dpal.kar.nic.in/16 of 1973 (E).pdf\n\nIt is also important to not the difference between \""operational issues\"" vs \""defect\"".\n\nAny product comes with a warranty for certain period. Warranty is to assure that the product would function precisely the way it is expected to be under prescribed conditions. Taking into account wear and tear due to its use  the warranty is time bound.\nIn our case  we have purchased a flat within a complex  of which a lift is an integral part. We paid an integrated cost for all equipment. Lift is being used as per the prescribed conditions (unless proven otherwise)\n\nSection 7.3 of KOFA  1972 provides the buyers a warranty period of 1 year for error-free  defect-free operations of the equipment within/outside the flat  as long as it is within the building complex.\n\nSection 7.4 of KOFA  1972 also arms the buyers to report the matter to the Department of Electrical Inspectorate.\n\nWith evergrowing menace in the way the whole Westend Heights Project is being handled by DLF  it is only practical for DLF to address this problem on its own cost at the soonest.\n\nRead section 7.3 and 7.4 of the Act above -\n\n===========\n(3) If any defect in the building or material used  or if any unauthorised change in the construction is brought to the notice of the promoter within a period of one year from the date of handing over possession  it shall wherever possible  be rectified by the promoter without further charge to the persons who have agreed to take the flats  and in other cases such persons shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for such defect or change. \n\n(4) Where there is a dispute as regards any defect in the building or material used  or any unauthorised change in the construction or as to whether it is reasonably possible for the promoter to rectify any such defect or change or as regards the amount of reasonable compensation payable in respect of any such defect or change which cannot be  or is not  rectified by the promoter the matter shall  on payment of such fee as may be prescribed  be referred for decision to such officer not lower in rank than a Superintending Engineer as the State Government may by general or special order specify in this behalf  within a period of two years from the date of handing over possession. Such officer shall after such enquiry as he deems necessary  record his decision  which shall be final. \n==============\n\nAlso read section 17 which supersedes any condition in any other contract.\n\n============\n17.

There was only one passenger lift operational without any lights inside. Luckily  I got in from the 20th floor (the couple did not know which button to press since it was completely dark inside). They wanted to get to the 16th floor.\n\nIn the morning too  a couple was stuck inside the lift for 30 minutes (refer Pankajâ€™s mail). Mohi has also put across the daily issues which the residents are facing.\n\nMore than anything  a lift getting stuck  and security unable to reach the same is â€œlife threateningâ€. Do you guys understand it? Shikha  why donâ€™t you live in the D Block for a few days and experience the issues which people are facing there. Sitting in your office  you are only promising some â€œprompt actionsâ€ â€“ which never happens.\n\nYour inaction to resolve the lift issue is criminal in nature  and should be brought to the notice of the police.

It is a pain to tackle autorickshaw drivers with their constant demands to pay more than what the amount comes by meter. For eg.  if a minimum fare is Rs. 25 now  they are not willing to go within 1.5kms if the amount if not Rs. 30 to Rs. 40. Or  if the fare comes out to be Rs. 80 at 9pm in the evening  they demand for Rs. 100  or even 1.5 to 2 times the fare  for late night charges  even if the night charges are applicable only post 10pm. 80% of the autorickshaw drivers I request to take me to a certain location say an outright no  if I am adamant to tell them that I\'ll be paying only by the meter. In Mumbai  this would never be the case with autos nor taxis  as the rules are quite strict. Even in Delhi in recent times  the autorickshaws are running on meter  and not overcharging as there is always a threat to them if we complain on the direct helpline no. However  in Bangalore  many of us aren\'t even aware of such an option to lodge a complaint against autorickshaw drivers who don\'t run by the meter. Is there a possibility that they cant say no to us if we request them to run by meter  and take us to any specified location  and only pay the right fare amount.

The width of the road itself is very narrow and there is a crowded railway gate (Shampur Railway Gate) in between. In addition to this  almost 8 months back  authorities dug the road for water pipe work and the present situation of this road is very pathetic. Daily thousands of vehicles including Cabs  school vans etc. are passing through this way as this is the shortest path to reach Nagavara Signal / Hennur Depot from R T Nagar. So many potholes are there in this road and once it rains travelling is hectic and the two-wheeler s are the most sufferers !,Bad Patches,Drainage chokes and blockages,Person falling in Manhole
Few months ago a sewage was dug in my street & stones were laid.However it was not covered & it was not connected to the main drainage. Due to this the sewage water is blocked & resulting in mosquito menace and also there is a high risk of children\'s falling into it.,Mosquito nuisance,Fogging,"Maintenance of municipal property, schools, dispensaries, maternity home, gardens"
The road in our lane was dug for bwssb works close to 1 1/2 month earlier for relaying of sewage pipes which was completed. The debris is yet to be removed & road has to be brought back to good condition which can be done by taring it newly. Debris lying here is causing lot of inconvenience to all residents in terms of vehicle movement  too much of mosquito menace  potential health hazard  dust from debris coming in our residences  parking issues. Just cleaning the debris will not bring the lane back to normal condition as it was earlier. On priority request the needful to be done.

Sir / Madam \n\nI would like to bring to your notice the condition of the median section on Outer Ring Road  right opposite to Rainbow Children Hospital (Doddenakundi).  Due to poor construction quality  this particular median section has been damaged.  With each passing day  the median gap has widened so much that 2-wheeler commuters are using it as a regular U-turn.  Please refer to the picture attached for your reference.  \n\nNot only does this pose a huge safety issue for speeding vehicles on the Outer Ring Road coming in from both KR Puram as well as Marathahalli  but it is also a blatant violation of traffic rules.  I myself have been in a situation where I\'ve had to brake suddenly to \'give way\' to the 2-wheelers who think it\'s ok to use this broken median as a legal U-turn.  \n\nPlease be informed that I have counted at least 6 such places on the Outer Ring Road  right from Doddenakundi till Bellandur where such broken medians have been intentionally damaged so that 2-wheelers can use it.  \n\nI would request the municipal authorities to take action immediately  before it causes serious risk to the commuters on this road.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Hawkers,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain"

Rains in Bangalore are not a new thing. The foot paths in Whitefield near ITPL to hoodi circle are completely unusable during the rains. They get filled with water  are used as parking and full of wide holes with thick long iron pipes scattered all over the place. The traffic congestion causes these muddy footpaths to be used as side roads. This is on both sides of the road.    The pedestrians have to eventually walk on the road making it unsafe for them and susceptible to mud splashes by vehicles. So many people living nearby prefer to drive to offices just a km away than walking because the walk is so dirty and dangerous.  There are no signals for pedestrians on the crossing and they just have to run half the road when traffic on that half stops moving. They crowd on the dividers in between moving traffic on either side. No zebra crossing. Running across whenever they get their break even if the traffic signal is green. This is just sad. This adds to the traffic problems in Whitefield.    The restaurant Punjabi by Nature laid down stones on the footpath in front of it's own building for their aesthetics but they now use the public footpath as their private parking. The pedestrians are often forced to the road on that patch now. This is right in front of the crossing under the nose of the traffic cops.    Owing to the IT parks nearby I have seen a lot of foreigners/expats walking on these footpaths. I wonder every time what image they would be taking back home of our country. Many of them come on business trips no longer than a few days. This is all they get to see. Today I saw a group of foreigners struggling to walk on the footpath. Honked by bikes trying to bypass traffic and splashing mud on pedestrians. From their attire you could guess they were here on a business trip. From their expression I wondered if they were sad they wore that business suit or maybe that it rained or they regretted traveling to India altogether.    It's unfathomable how such a horrible condition would be allowed to reach by the Government when:    1. This place is home to more than half a dozen International Tech Parks.  2. It generates a huge amount of revenue and money inflow into the nation.  3. The residents  mostly working in IT and related firms nearby  pay taxes proportion to their salaries which relatively is high.  4. This problem is persistent since many YEARS. Since this place's inception there was never a footpath. An unpaved mudpile on the sides of the road is being used to walk by pedestrians.   5. It has caused so many accidents. Pedestrians walking on the road sides are hit by moving volvos and bikes trying to squeeze their way. Bikes on the footpaths honk on slow walking pedestrians.  6. It has a huge potential to influence the image of the country.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1LiCkof1cs  This video of the stretch from Hope farm to Hoodi shot before the rains shows the pathetic state of this whole matter. Wonder how horrible it is to walk or drive on this path during the rains!    The road and footpath connecting to ITPL from hope farm is in an appalling state. They have been dug up and left covered unusable by pedestrians and the muddy in the holes on the roads makes it impossible to walk on the road as well. The effective width of the road has shrunk and it causes traffic problems.    I went through ICMC and found that this stretch of road had tons of complaints. I hope this matter would be considered of high importance since it's affecting a lot of citizens.    http://www.ichangemycity.com/complaints/footpath-stretch-laden-with-huge-drainage-pipes-for-months-together-now    http://www.ichangemycity.com/bangalore/complaints/hopeform-to-kr-puram-main-road-digged-and-not-repaired    http://www.ichangemycity.com/bangalore/complaints/entire-whitefield-road-has-become-12-lane    http://www.ichangemycity.com/bangalore/complaints/daily-traffic-jam-at-hope-farm-junction-with-a-possible-solution,Bad Patches,Odour  foul smell  from drains,Drainage chokes and blockages

A couple of months ago a \'uniformed\' gang of workers started digging roads in R T Nagar. We were told that they have been \'awarded\' the contract by the BWSSB to dig roads to lay new pipe lines. We were pleasantly surprised to see a gang of L&T workers doing their job  they looked like thorough professionals. It turned out to be a mirage. The dug holes they had filled turned out to be death traps  especially after the unusual rains unleashed their fury. They also cut the roads to connect pipes to respective homes close to the existing water metres. They assured all that they would fill the holes and close them with cement and bring them to their original condition. It was a shock to see the gang \'filling and cementing\' the holes! Job done  they all vanished and the cemented portions have given way. This from a reputed firm like L&T!!\n\nWe always criticise the PWD department for shoddy work. At least one private agency has proved that it is no different. It would be nice for some agency to take a tour in R T Nagar and take stock of the condition they have created. \n\nS D Chakravarthy,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

This is about the prepaid taxi services provided by the Bangalore and airport taxi drivers union (R) approved by Government of Karnataka at the Cantonment railway station. When autos are a bit stremlined here  taxis are not. The Taxis are in horrible conditions most of them the Omni vans  Non AC. It is only after you go near the taxi allotted you know what you are in for. The prepaid charges costed me 380 rupees plus 20 rupees as service charges. After coming home I checked on the web. For a distance of 12 kms it it around 160 rupees. What is this union about. The members all seem to birds of the same feather. How can Government of Karnataka register and permit such unfair charges for lousy vehicles. This has to be taken up by some other outside agency for review for an unbiased purview. Getting the right services and facilities for the money we pay is a citizen\'s right. But I reinsist it has to be taken up by an outside agency  otherwise I don\'t expect justice. No opening kilometers  no closing. No AC  not a proper car but a repaired omni vehicle. Ironically all the vehicles were in similar condition. No chart display of the kind of vehicle allottted or the fares (random- muh bola daam!) where are we living?The computer at the counter also was disfunctional.

This is the only medium we have to complain. I request ICmyC to ask BBMP to take these complaints seriously.     In spite of so many complaints in past and BBMP closing the complaints as resolved and in spite of High Court passing the order to clear the footpath of all encroachers they remain encorached. Pedestrians are forced to walk on the roads and face the rash driving of our citizens.    When we ask encroachers to remove the obstacle they get down to fight and tell us to mind our business. Because of inefficiency of BBMP citizens are suffering and that too inspite of paying heavy taxes to the government. There is no accountability. People are fearless of any laws they do as they wish there is no one governing these people. The only few who take rules  laws and regulation seriously always suffer under the non followers. Government does nothing to safeguard the citizens against these errant encroachers.    I request BBMP to clear all encroachment on this road.

Attached are some photos of a road in JP Nagar 2nd phase. You might think  looking at these   that the earthquake hit Bangalore too.

Last Tuesday BBMP workers again dug the pits up   piled the mud across gates and promised to cover it with aggregate  (jelly ) and tar the road in the next 2 days.

In addition  The road at Nallurhalli was dug up completely to lay sewer lines. When is this stretch going to be relaid?\n\nRequests: \n1) When you lay a road  please cut the old road tar and and relay with new tar. If you just paste a layer on the top  it is not going to stick to the layer underneath and not going to last for more than a couple of years. In addition  use gravel and clay and press them with road rollers before laying tar.\n2) Please finish the road work with a month from starting. You cannot take an year to finish a road causing inconvenience to commuters all the time.\n3) Before laying a road think in advance whether any sewer lines  cables need to be laid and do so before laying a road  not afterwards.\n4) When you dig up a road relay it with in month.\n\nPlease let us know when you are planning on repairing/finishing the Borewell road. \nWho ever is responsible for these roads is doing the worst job possible.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Despite of all the BMTC Buses plying from Madiwala-market(1-Way) towards Silk board  stops and boards the passengers in the market road(bus stop)  still some educated & ignorant lazy-passengers continue standing in the junction(madiwala traffic police station corner) ahead of the destined bus stop and choke the traffic here Unnecessarily!..    What is shocking and pathetic is to see that There is a big banner installed here in the junction (with Picure sign)instructing the passengers not to board the 'bus' at this spot  and choke the junction. However the shameless Rowdy BMTC Driver's ignore and stop here for these shameless passengers to board at the junction  ignoring the honks of other vehicles and buses awaiting behind to take the left turn towards Silk board.  This creates traffic congestion at the junction  by preventing vehicles to take a free left-turn.    It is my kind request that the concerned traffic dept. and officialâ€™s posted here should:  (a) Not allow passengerâ€™s to stand below the said Banner and still disobey the rules  set.  (b) Not allow the BMTC buses to stop at the junction even for few seconds unnecessarily &  (c) Most importantly the automatic doorâ€™s (Back & Front) of these buses should be closed by the Driver of the BMTC Bus - once the passengers have boarded it at the bus stop  and â€˜door-closedâ€™ before approaching the â€˜dreaded junctionâ€™  Else these smart-educated-lazy-shameless-passengers(mostly Young Men and Women) pretend to be a â€œpedestrianâ€ right below the flex sign board and on seeing the BMTC bus door open and its slowing down while taking the left turn  get off the footpath and stop the bus at this junction and board it : choking the signal!!.

Their nuisance has increased in the recent days. Every night  a group of them involve in a fight with each other  bark and haul loudly till the dawn. This keeps the residents up all night. They are fond of scattering the garbage all over the streets from somewhere. I am afraid if their population is left unchecked  then there might be complaints of dog bites as well. We don\'t want the dogs to be culled or harmed but we suggest that they can be evacuated from the area  sterilized and sheltered elsewhere.

This attached photo is the picture of vijaya bank colony  dodda banaswadi  outer ring road  Bangalore - 560043. Here the outer ring road and service road merges  before Milan Marbles and Granite\'s on the service road. Nearly 100 meters there is no road divider separation between outer ring road and service road  this is very dangerous. Because vehicles coming from both ring road and service road merges in V-shape at high speed. And also there is no road humps in both service road and ring road to control speed of vehicles. \nSecond  we have to cross dangerous high speed ring road to catch the bus  if we have to travel towards opposite direction. We request to put big scientific hump on both outer-ring road and service road and also sky walk  where ever bus stop on entire stretch of the ring road.\nSame fate on other side of the ring road  near ASR convention hall. There also speedily vehicle merges in V-shape speedily. There also put big scientific hump in both ring road and service road and increase the road divider between ring road and service on the junctions.\nThis pro-active steps will avoid the incidents which happened last day(26-FEB-2015) in ring road  near hebbal.\n\nI have posted above in Facebook to Bangalore Traffic Police  but I am yet to get a reply.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property

The stretch between Outer Ring Road  Bhadrappa Layout and Kodigehalli Ganesha Temple is one of the worst roads in Bangalore. With potholes dotting the entire stretch  accompanied by mud and drainage work that has been ongoing for over 3 years this also happens to be one of the most neglected areas despite coming within BBMP/BDA limits.

Dear Sir/Madam  I  as a Resident of Dodda Banaswadi area  Bangalore take the privilege of bringing to your kind attention to the stray dog menace in the locality of Dodda Banaswadi (surrounding to Anjaneya Temple). For the last four months the number of stray dogs in the locality have increased manifold and the people living in this area have been terror-striken by such dogs. It is also most obnoxious and disturbing when these stray dogs start barking in chorus continuing for prolonged time at all the nights robbing of slumber of the people. It is now of paramount necessity to get rid of these dogs immediately from this locality so that the residents living in this area can heave a sigh of relief. Looking to the gravity of the situation I would request your good-self to take immediate remedial measures to rid this area from the obnoxious menace. Your immediate action in the matter will be highly appreciated. Thanking you  Yours faithfully.

World class cities like Dubai and big western metropolitan cities use underground electricity distribution system. This should be done in Bangalore too. Underground electricity cables  poles  telephone wires and transformers would help prevent the damage caused due to environmental factors like rain and heavy winds which cause power cuts and disconnection of telephone lines. Moreover  telephone and electricity poles and transformers are also an obstruction to pedestrians on the footpaths. If these are put underground then we\'ll have spacious and wider footpaths. Often we hear cases of people getting electrocuted due to cables falling or transformers. A transformer bursting can also be dangerous for people. If these are put underground it will also improve public safety. Tangled wires also make the city skyline look congested. If these are underground the skyline would look much beautiful. I request the concerned authorities to consider this matter with utmost importance and help make Bangalore a world class metropolitan city.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

As they had not made grooves in the road first and cleaning it before applying a generous layer of bitumen  and then applying the mixture of crushed stone and again good amount of bitumen  whatever job done is unlikely to remain in place after even a small rain.

Basically pedestrians take the road as the space is occupied by vehicles and it slows down the traffic.\n\nThe area near KR Puram Market  many vehicles are parked right on the road  and BMTC/KSRTC/APSRTC buses stop in the middle of road for on-boarding/de-boarding buses choking the traffic. The fun part is  all this happens right infront of KR Puram Traffic Police station  but the concerned authority turns a blind eye to this.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Garbage dumps are all over Bangalore  but this one on BTM 30th main (Lake road) is a perennial that just randomly shows up overnight and refuses to move for months. This has been happening for quite sometime now but this time I thought its about time someone did something about it and I registered on this platform specifically to report this. All residents of 30th main will vouch that the road reeks of rotting garbage that makes you sick to your stomach.

1.Heavy Vehicles entering/exiting Devasandra Main Road. There is a sign board at the start of road on either side indicating HTVs are prohibited to enter the Devasandra Main Road  but no one bothers. Also the HTVs can\'t just handle the narrow curves on that road. Here HTVs include trucks  big buses (BMTC/Private). Solution would be mini buses or route diversion.\n\n2. Senseless auto rickshaw drivers waiting for passengers creating major congestion. Many times they are warned by traffic inspector  but it will only last for the day.\n\n3. Coming to hawkers or sellers on wheels  they occupy one-fourth road. Added to that they come to that location in the morning (8am around) from their places  which again chokes the traffic because the carts are manually pushed.\n\n4. Pedestrians  they walk on road (some times walking next to next instead in a row) as most of the pedestrian path is occupied by the shopkeepers for their shop extension.\n\n5. And there are vehicles stopped by road-side for parking. Parking is not done in a proper manner  some vehicle owners ensure their parking so as to limit the traffic movement.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages

Many shopkeepers extended their shops to the foot path and occupy most of the footpath rendering it useless for pedestrians. Part of the footpath which is left free is used by movable cart vendors (vegetables/fruits). Effectively most of the footpath is occupied and as a result pedestrians walk on roads in groups making driving hazardous. Safety of both pedestrians and people driving is compromised. Few stretches of footpath is unfit for pedestrian use as it is used for dumping waste.

Dear BBMP Colleagues \n\nI am Archana Prasad working as S/W Engineer at SAP labs. \nI got your mail ID from BBMP site and i have a thought to improve traffic Condition at Graphite Signal which i have been taking since 4 years.\n\nLocation: Graphite India Signal Itpl Main Road  Brookefield  Bangalore - 560037 \nWard # 85\n\nIn 3 years i see there is much increase in Traffic on this road.\nThere is huge Traffic at Graphite Signal all the time on all the weekdays.\nThere are more than 50 IT companies in the ITPL Main road  but there is only one road(no alternate way)\n\nAs you can see in the screen shot attached  Graphite signal is the place which takes min 20 mins to cross. This is the point where traffic from K.R.Puram  Videhi and Marathalli meets.\nIf you see most of the companies are on the Right of the Kundalahalli lake.\nBut to reach there  all company buses or 2 wheelers or 4 wheelers need to cross Graphite Signal. Though there are many traffic police men to manage traffic  because of the huge number of vehicles taking Graphite signal to reach offices it really takes long time at the signal. Traffic will increase day by day because of new constructions and new Offices in this area. \nThe only way to manage traffic is to have alternate way to reach Videhi.\n\n1 km road near Kundalahalli Lake can surely reduce 1/3 traffic at Graphite.\nAlready there is kaccha road near lake which is taken by few ppl who are aware of it.\nLeft road is presently blocked by Villagers whos are simply staying there for free and polluting the lake and surroundings.\n\nMy request to you is to have a view on this plan. \nThis road would surely be an advantage to all IT company employees and also to Traffic police in managing traffic.\n\nAlso I have raised several compains(134424  137687 n 139222) for potholes and bad Road at Graphite signal. But no action is taken. Please engage respective authorities look in to the complains.\n\nThanks in advance and hoping for the best :)\n\nRegards \nArchana,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages,Bad Patches

We are residents of Indiranagar 1st Stage and live very close to the newly opened pub  â€˜Three Dots and a Dashâ€™. This pub is located on the first floor and has an open terrace above that. The terrace has no soundproofing and the loud music disturbs the neighborhood.\n\nWe are writing to complain about the level of sound we are left to face almost on a daily basis. They are always playing very loud music that we can hear till late at night. Some of us have made calls to the police station at night to complain. When the police go there the music is turned down but after ten minutes the music goes up again. The music is loud on almost all evening/nights of the week and also on Sunday afternoons. We have given a written complaint to the Indiranagar police station with signatures from the people who live on the road behind where we live.\n\nAs neighbors we have gone and spoken to the owners  Vamsi  Siddharth and Raghu. We have also spoken to the operations manager Victor and another manager  Dennis. Despite these discussions and repeated requests from us to turn the music down nothing has been down about the level of sound. \n\nWe request you to please help initiate action to stop this nuisance. Most of the people affected by the sound are senior citizens who have been living here for many decades. It disturbs our sleep and peace on a regular basis.,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Major repairs to municipal property

My wife the other day was driving rather slowly (she\'s a very careful rules-abiding person) from RICHMOND ROAD and taking a RIGHT TURN towards the RESIDENCY ROAD. And at the circle when she sees a GREEN signal  takes a turn (i.e. coming from LEFT-SIDE of Richmond Rd to the LEFT-SIDE of Residency Rd). But on request of the traffic police officer standing on the right-side of Residency Rd turns towards him. And the police officer says that she had defaulted a signal and puts a fine on her  which she pays.\n\nNow analyzing where she had made a mistake  we ask the officer why fine when she took a turn only on seeing the right-turn signal (which was still glowing as it had 15 secs more to go). He responds that the RIGHT-TURN signal is only for the RIGHT-SIDE riders on the RICHMOND ROAD  and NOT for the LEFT-SIDE riders of it  and also mentions that there was also a NO-RIGHT-TURN board put over there. This is purely a confusion for the riders on this road  esp those who do not ply on it regularly. And also goes on to state that the board was put there by the BBMP dept  hence Traffic Police is not answerable to it.\n\nNow can someone think about a driver too  and understand that the eyes aren\'t a 360 deg camera. Especially when someone sees a RIGHT-TURN-SIGNAL brightly glowing  they barely can presume that the same road will also have a NO-RIGHT-TURN board to be present as well. I hope the department  be it the Traffic Police or the BBMP also to be humans and probably agree to the same.\n\nA SIMPLE SOLUTION could\'ve been - have a RIGHT-TURN-SIGNAL on the RIGHT-SIDE of the the Richmond Rd so that riders on that side of the road only can see it  and take a turn  instead of putting the signal on a central location for both sides sides (on opposite side of the road). This probably could be a more rationale way of doing things  and LEFT-SIDE-riders when they do not see a signal will automatically oblige with whatever shown to them  and a NO-RIGHT-TURN board may not even be required perhaps. Plz do not CONFUSE the INNOCENT riders  and take undue advantage of their obedience to the law.\n\nBTW right while we were talking to the police officer  there were so many riders outrightly defaulting  jumping the red signal and other violations  and the officer was not even able to do anything about it. And when we question that  he rather says that do you want to be a good citizen or take the path of a bad one - strangely police likes to only take advantage of the innocent people  while they cannot do something about the serious offenders.\n\nHopefully the department(s) can do something about it for the future. Thank you.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

The average ground clearance of any vehicle especially the cars is 150-168mm. This reduces even further  if the vehicle is fully loaded with passengers. Hence cars cannot cross that smoothly.

I appreciate the efforts of  Bangalore Traffic Police in this regard who are always there to help people cross road or manage traffic but I think a a footbridge across the road will be an easy  and long term solution .

Team   This BESCOM Transformer from years is Installed on the main road. This Road stretch due to newly constructed residential complex adjacent to it (comprising of 47 flats)  and Narayana E-Techno school  now has many private and public vehicles playing. Having this Transformer on the main road  lead to the road being congested leading to inconvenience to commute. This would be wise to shift this Transformer now to the side of Lake or some other appropriate place when this entire road stretch from Puttenahalli main road (Govt school) towards Narayana E-techno school is very busy with many vehicles playing on it .Thanks for looking into this concern.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Unauthorised construction development

After many years of complaints and follow up the issue of bad roads and absence of storm water drains had been addressed by way of a work contract to have this built in Green Glen Layout near the sobha apartments. However  while the storm water drains have been built on both sides of the road from Sobha hibiscus till Sobha Mayflower  the work is incomplete since they are not able to take it to bellandur lake !! There seems to be an issue of identifying freehold / public land access to the lake through which they may dig the last stretch of the storm water drain. With access to the lake being only through private land there is the immediate need to gain permission to lay proper pipelines connecting the storm water drain to the lake. Who is to bell the cat ??

The roads also get difficult to be used because of garbage heaps here and there and it all comes down to the cleanliness issue.

Since yrs this road is under one way traffic rule.\nIt is a different thing that despite the board displayed  youngers / auto drivers take pride in entering into the lane and negotiate.\nIt will be wise enough to ease the congestion if this road is made as a  2 way traffic at least for 2 wheelers / cars on Saturdays and Sundays and on week days between 11 am - 2pm and after 4 pm onwards when there is no crowd of the school (Baldwin School situated here) going children and their parents.\nIt will make a big difference at the junction of Nanjappa Circle Near Food World also for sure.\nIt is worth giving a try. \nAlso there are many roads in the city that can be made 2 ways which will surely help the commuters reach the destination easily and quickly.,Removal of rank regulation on roads,Signals,Repairs re-surfacing of roads footpaths

To  BBMP Corporator \nShivajinagar Ward92 \nBangalore - 560051\nSub: Complaint letter to BBMP Corporator Shivajinagar Ward92 on unhygienic sanitary condition.\nDear Sir \nIn the capacity of the of the Residents of Ghouse Mansion  293 Thimmaiah Main road  Behind Madras-e- Niswan Girls Urdu school  Shivajinagar  Ward 92  Bangalore - 560051  let me draw your attention to the unhygienic sanitary condition prevailing in the locality  which need the immediate attention of the Municipality or concern responsible.\nThe stagnant waters  the foul smelling drains and the un-removed garbage  have made life very miserable for the residents. Heaps of garbage lies near the garbage area. Even the dust-bins remain full to capacity. They are not cleared for weeks. The stagnant pools of water while raining have become a breeding place for flies and mosquitoes. Stray dogs and animals surround the dustbins. An epidemic is expected any moment due to the unhygienic conditions here.\nComplaints lodged at the local office proved futile. The situation still remains the same. If immediate steps are not taken to improve the sanitary conditions of the locality  the life of the residents will be in danger  Moreover the people are using this place as Urinating which is a shameful act and for us to stay in this locality becoming huge trouble  every time we and our children required to visit the Doctors for irregular dirty air surrounded by the pollution. (Please see the attached pictures for your action).\nKindly take necessary steps to improve the situation of Residents of Ghouse Mansion  293 Thimmaiah Main Road  Behind Madras-e- Niswan Girls Urdu School  Shivajinagar  Ward 92  Bangalore â€“ 560051\nThanking you \nYours faithfully \nResidents.,Unauthorised construction development,Drainage chokes and blockages,Unauthorised construction in slum
This is with respect to the railway track passing through railway parallel road  kumara park.  Trains passing by at all hours have a tendency to blow their horns which is not only causing noise pollution due to the sound levels but also increased disturbance to the residential areas and their residents around railway parallel road due to unnecessary horns at all hours of the day and night.   There is no reason for a moving train to blow its horn continuously while passing through such areas.

It is almost six months  I might have made entry in the complaint book of BSK TTMC office on the buses being parked on the road opp TTMC without entering the TTMC as well as commuters being made to alight at the unspecified point and to make a road crossing to connect the other buses on more than 10 occasions as well as several mails and mobile messages to CTMO  BMTC. Till now there is neither any acknowledgement nor any action taken to ensure the safety of commuters as it is the duty of the BMTC to ensure the passengers are made to alight at the bus stand and not on the road when they wish to connect the buses to onward journeys.  This adds to the inconvenience  as several buses does not enter the BSK TTMC bus stand and carries commuters who are on the unspecified locations wherein the commuters waiting at the TTMC have to bear the brunt of waiting for the next bus.  It is hoped that if the bmtc have the run on profit  it should discipline their staff such as drivers/conductors as well as depot inspectors who would be sitting inside the office.  CTMO needs to ensure that action taken report be sent to the redressal person to  bring in the confidence of the BMTC working.

Due to sudden explosion of traffic around Whitefield especially near Graphite India it is increasing becoming dangerous for the motor bike riders and pedestrians. The auto rickshaws have contributed to this part by driving recklessly and exhorting money from the commuters and victims.\nI would like to narrate my story  Thursday(13th-Aug)  morning I set out from my home near bigbasket go-down to my office on my bike and I was hit by an auto rickshaw while taking a turn all because of the speeding auto rickshaw who instead of stopping took a sudden left turn and his back wheel hit my bike and since he was travelling at more than 60 kmph I and my bike fell flat and instead of stopping to help me the auto rickshaw tried to flee but had to stop because the passenger who was kind lady stopped him and people around me helped me on the feet but Once the lady left the scene the auto rickshaw driver called his associated and soon there were around 10 auto drivers assembled at the scene and with out showing no concerns to my wounds and my damaged bike started accusing me of driving rashly and started to demand money. Meanwhile I called the Police (100) control room and informed about the situation but to my horror even after calling them the second time no Police arrived at the scene for more than 1 hour. finally I had to give Rs. 500 to one of the auto drivers and as I was in great pain and leave the scene. I won\'t blame police as I later found out that the all police men were busy on duty for Independence day or BBMP election rally security. Please advise me on how solve this problem.

Dear Concerned  Recently it has been seen that much of the foot path spaces near apartments and important junctions are taken over by illegally occupied Auto-rikshaw unions. Example are Hope Farm Signal  Sindhu Bhairavi apartments  Goplaan grandeur apartments Hoodi  Prestige shantinikethan etc. Since pedestrians have a very difficult task of navigating these stretches as they are very busy  Removal or proper placement of these rickshaw stands away from the foot path will allows pedestrians to walk and reach thier destinations safely. Added to that most of the Autos here make place dirty by their constant spitting of Pan  smoking  commenting on females/girls walking to the foot path etc and making scene with passengers asking for a fair price to the driver.

As if the traffic problems were not enough in Marthahalli  not sure why Traffic police took the decision to open up the direct connection from just after Marthahalli bridge to the outer ring road. At any given point in time  you can see so much chaos at this junction during any part of the day:\n\n1) Traffic is stranded as police is manually trying to control the traffic. Not sure why it decided to open up more U turns and access to outer ring road when already there are 2 ways possible  via the under bridge after U turn at Home Town and via U turn before Brand Factory (old).\n\n2) Despite a well maintaned over bridge  pedestrians crossing roads frantically. It is a bug chaos at this place with people try to walk on roads  stopping vehicles when actually they can safely cross roads through the over bridge. \n\nUrge traffic police to put the barricade back at the Marthahalli junction  opposite to A2B  as removing it has only caused more chaos and not reduced any traffic problem. Vehicles are now stranded from Kundanahalli junction through the entire marthahalli bridge and crossing this 1.5 KM stretch takes 30 minutes at any given day. I am not even sure if the bridge is strong enough to hold this amount of vehicle traffic as i can sometimes feel slight tremors in the bridge as huge vehicles pass.\n\nImmediate Action NEEDED.

As a first attempt  I put some concrete along with sand  stones and tried to cover it but since the base below it is sinking (I think its sinking  into the main hole next to it) it is opening and growing again. In a few days  it will be developed into a big opened dip hole stopping all the traffic on  this way.

People in Pillanna Garden have not realized the importance of a public park yet. What was once a barren ground is now a tiny park in the middle of a dusty area. Having a park is not enough; one should also take proper care of it. People have been throwing garbage all around the park like it is a normal thing to do. I have asked some of them not to do it and instead use places allocated for garbage disposal. No one would listen. All of them reply arrogantly that I should be happy that they are not dumping garbage inside my house !! The park is open in the mornings and evenings and people are scared to get in because the place is more filthy that the dump yards. There is a bad stench that would not go away. There are mosquitoes that have made the park their breeding ground. And there are these trouble makers who are drunk 24*7 who use the park as their play area. To make matters worse  the garbage collectors ignore all of the garbage that is lying around the park. When questioned  they ask us to go and report it to the officers as they do not fear them anymore !! We want our park back and we want the area around the park to be clean. We want our children to play without worry about falling sick. We want our elders to enjoy whatever little time that they get in the mornings and evenings to stay healthy. I would really appreciate it if this issue is taken up as soon as possible.

At present as the bus stop is provided just after the traffic signal at jayadeva junction on 100 feet ring road  all the BMTC busses coming from silk board stop just after the jayadeva junction creating traffic snarls/jams. Sometimes three or four busses stop haphazardly on the ring road itself and block the traffic thereby very few vehicles can pass the signal resulting in avoidable traffic jams leading to ear splitting honking by irate motorists  causing noise pollution and . It is suggested to shift the bus stop further towards mini-forest at least 500 feet away from jayadeva junction.,Minor repairs to municipal property,Bad Patches,Sweeping of road
It is surprising that no pedestrian crossing is envisaged under jayadeva flyover to go either from Jayadeva hospital to Gopalan mall crossing 100 feet ring road or the other way round. Neither there is signal lights nor a zebra cross envisaged. Due to this all children  old and young people going towards Jayadeva hospital  or coming from Jayadeva hospital side are forced to cross the ring road  wading through the heavy traffic risking their life. \nSame is the case while going to KEB layout ( towards silk board) or coming from KEB layout to Jayadeva Hospital side there is no traffic signal for pedestrian crossing.\nTraffic signal for pedestrian crossing is a must and should be envisaged.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Hawkers

All the garbage collected from the area  including Maruthi Nagar and S.G.

An entire stretch of road  may be 100mts  are piled up with garbage and during rains it flows down the road. This is a big health hazard. There are a lot of pedestrians who use this road to get to Hosur Road (Madiwala Gate) and they face tremendous problems. Also all the garbage on the roads are picked up by the wheels of vehicles and spread in adjoining localities. The garbage is collected by small three wheeler tempos and hence they dump on the road. It is important that the BBMP uses compactor trucks to collect garbage and ferry it directly to the dump yard. Earlier this was the practice but for the last many months this has stopped.

Since the population of bengaluru is increasing exponentially very high..we request to consider this as our request for increasing the number of bus services to avoid the situations like people hanging at the door which is very dangerous and highly prone to accidents.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

My unheard complaint to BBMP since years.\n\nIt is with immense displeasure I\'m writing a humble request to you to shift the Bus Stop away from Liquor Bar.\n\nI stay in MS Palya (located near Vidyaranyapura - Bangalore North).\nThere are thousands of people commuting from my area since it is one of a junction which connects few places around it.\n\nThere was road widening in 2008 to make a peripheral road for airport. However a strong politically influential people building in the heart of the Bus stop was never moved down to make a proper bus stop then.\n\nSo the bus stop since that day continued on road itself without a proper shelter.\n\nNow to add to the misery and only for the worst the BUS STOP HAS BEEN SHIFTED TO EXACT SPOT OF A LIQUOR BAR. \n\nWe have school going and college going children including teen girls who have to inevitable stand at that spot. We know what shall be the social and mental consequence of this on our children.\n\nTherefore for the betterment of our future generation and on humanity grounds it is my humble request you to either close the bar or shift the bus stand at a better location away from a liquor bar.,Drainage chokes and blockages,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Pollution due to chemical effluents

NOW NO MORE INCIDENTS SHOULD HAPPEN AND WHETHER WE ARE READY TO LEARN FROM THIS ?\n\n?\nPoor governance is the bane of most cities in India. Civic agencies are ill equipped to meet the growing needs of cities. Be it 24X7 power and drinking water supply  solid waste management  maintenance of roads and footpaths  fast transport and communication  illumination of streets at night  protection of greenery  disposal of sewage and drain water  etc. Those to manage cities  from elected representatives to bureaucrats  keep running around in circles when ever problems surface.

In Pai Lay Out BBMP people are coming regularly to collect waste on alternate days. Many apartments are handing over the waste duly segregated as dry and wet waste. But many of the individual house near by are not following the same.    In Pai Layout 12th cross  in a corner of  one of the empty site garbage is being dumped by the residents  shop owners around and residents from near by area. Many times people coming in two wheelers and four wheelers from near by area simply throw the garbage in this spot.   The garbage is getting accumulated  and not being cleared for many long days.  We have complained to the AEE AE and EE in charge of this area  they have come and seen and despite that no action is being taken in spite of their  promises.  The whole place is stinking and is becoming a health hazard. Dogs/cows/buffalos are coming in search search of food ( owners need to be questioned?) spread the garbage and making it is worst.    We need immediate clearance and also request authorities to display board not to dump the garbage in this place. They should put their people or place cc camera in that area to capture the people who are  dumping the garbage and put penalty so that they stop putting garbage and it becomes a lesson for others.    While this is the situations  at  this particular cross   there are many areas like this in Pai lay out. The authorities should attend to all these.    Moreover  the female sweepers who come to clean up are not equipped with proper equipment. Therefore  they take the easy option of pushing the swept garbage either in the drains or come and dump it one of the site like this and is getting accumulated. The cleaning squad should be given proper equipment  and the garbage collected by them should be cleared   immediately.,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage lorry not reported for service

Whenever it rains  a sewage line overflows on 16th cross and sewage water enters the park with garbage.\n3. BBMP workers are in the habit of dumping garbage through the same opening in the fence whenever they are unable to clear garbage collected from the layout.\n4.

Problem: The Kasavanahalli main road is the main road which connects Sarjapur road to Hosur road. There are very minimal bus routes that ply here and that too in the peak time until 10AM and after 4PM in evenings. Private â€œAuto rickshawsâ€ are the only means to cover all the way from â€œKaikondrahalli junctionâ€ to â€œNaganathapuraâ€.  Solution:  a. Please introduce BMTC busses or new bus connectivity between â€“  1. Electronic city to Whitefield through Sarjapur road  2. Electronic city to Manyata tech park through Marathahalli.  The above routes will ease out the burden of traffic on the main roads of Bangalore and instead will leverage roads which are less used thus cutting down time and also improving accessibility to the new areas which will also generate development.  b. Please introduce BMTC busses or new bus connectivity between â€“  1. Wipro Corporate office  Sarjapur road to Banashankari  2. Wipro Corporate office  Sarjapur road to Girinagar  3. Wipro Corporate office  Sarjapur road to Hoskerahalli  The above bus connectivity will also reduce traffic overhead near these areas and help overall commute time as majority of commuters in our area are taking Agara road or Kasavanahalli main road to connect to Whitefield and Wipro corporate office.

This complaint is not targeted to any specific place in Bangalore. This is observed all over Bangalore and it\'s at peaks in the commercial areas like BTM  Whitefield  ITPL etc as there are numerous PG\'s  Broadband Companies  Community poster and public notices  local business etc. who are putting illegal posters to the trees using staple pins ans nails. This is affecting the trees because of the pin holes insects/pests make there way and eating them. This is causing slow death of trees as the pins and nails could damage the tissues responsible for moving water and nutrients through the tree. \nMany times i have tried to call the numbers mentioned in the posters and request them not to pin them to trees  but i get a bad response from them. Then i started removing posters from trees daily on my way to office and even spend 15 to 20 minutes removing pins as i carry small tool in my bag for this purpose and next day morning i can new posters on trees again.\n\nTrees are an important part of every community. Trees are public property no individual should not be allowed to use them for such purpose and destroy them. It also visually affecting the beauty of our city as entire trees are covered with hundreds of pins and posters.\n\nWe really need a strict law on illegal posters on trees. Bangalore needs no tolerance position toward the illegal posting of materials in public spaces. Taking care of the cityâ€™s existing green cover is just as important as planting more trees. I request to get such such law in action for the Clean  Green and Beautiful Bangalore.\n\nI am attached few photographs from ITPL road  which will clearly shows the condition of the trees and huge number of pins.,Drainage chokes and blockages,Unauthorised construction development,Private Land   Building   Society   Factories

Vani Vilas Road in Basavangudi  Bangalore runs from Lalbagh West Gate to Ramakrishna Ashram.  It is a nice broad road which was lined with beautiful trees once upon a time.   Many of these have been cut down indiscriminately making way for a flyover  the metro line and a broader road.  Although it is a busy main thoroughfare it is poorly maintained with the median broken  has pot-holes  has not been paved from one footpath to the opposite footpath and the huge problem is the garbage which is dumped in front of 66 Vani Vilas Road day in and day out.  Businesses like hotels  beauty parlors and homes nearby dump their waste close to the footpath  hang garlands on the only tree left near the corner causing immense hardship to the families living close-by.  Garbage is either not collected or a very shabby job is done.  Several complaints have gone unheard.  I hope this will be taken up seriously and whoever is responsible does his or her job honestly and properly by getting the work done or providing a proper system and place where everyone in the area can dump garbage.  The photos I am uploading show where garbage is dumped daily and never cleared [this part of the road is close to the National College Basavangudi flyover].\n\nThank you\n\nMrs. Nagarathna Venkataraman,Collection point not attended properly,Providing removing replacing dustbins,Removal of Debris

Day by day if we see around the traffic in Bangalore is increasing which is leading to the climate changes of Bangalore due to the pollution. A good amount of air pollution is caused by the Govt. buses plying through the city. Even the Volvo AC buses are contributing to this pollution. The state govt. or BMTC should do regular checks on the condition of these buses and ensure that they do not cause pollution by spewing out all the polluted exhaust. If this is ensured then the amount of particle matter in the air can be reduced to a significant level.

Garbage bags are blown by the breeze and lie strewn all around (pl see photo). Needless to say  this is unhygienic  ugly looking & gives off a foul odour. Also rats  dogs etc. visit it to find waste food. In the process  this could lead to the spread of various diseases.

The traffics situation in Bangalore is more than pathetic. Partly it is due to bad roads and partly due to zero traffic sense of commuters especially taxi  Tempo travellers and BMTC buses. Following are the suggestions for immediate improvement:\na) All BMTC bus drivers should be asked to drive in their dedicated bus lanes and avoid overtaking which they very commonly do.\nb) All BMTC bus drivers should be asked to strictly stop their buses very close to the bus stop and not in the center of the road which completely halts and disrupts the traffic behind it. None of the BMTC drivers seem to have had any training or instructions in this regard.\nc) Most of the roads need dividers up to the traffic signal to prevent commuters entering into other  peoples lane especially those coming from opposite direction. This needs to be implemented on emergency basis if any improvement is expected in Bangalore traffic. Over taking is the biggest issue putting others life into jeopardy!\nd) None of the traffic signals are synchronized with the other following it. This creates complete chaos on roads. When IT sector is in Bangalore why the traffic police does not take the initiative of approaching them and getting their help to synchronize traffic lights. Synchronizing of traffic lights means that the it will help to get a green light when u reach the next signal helping in decongestion of roads.\ne) CCTV cameras need to be installed on each main traffic junctions to monitor traffic violaters especially those who jump red lights.\nf) Create awareness about traffic regulations and rules by conducting a written test before issuing of driving licenses. This is not followed in any part of India at present. All developed nations do that and that is why people there follow traffic rules properly. Create awareness through newspapers  TV and other media!\ng) Parking of taxis  TTs  private vehicles etc along the arterial roads should be prohibited. Such vehicles should be towed away immediately. People should be made aware to park vehicles only in bylanes and not on main roads.\nh) There has to be some law to control the movement of cows on roads which is a common sight and is one of the main reasons for disrupting traffic all over Bangalore. Such animals should be taken away and released only on payment of heavy fines. Fine acts as a deterrent against future violation. Presently government does not want to do this as they don\'t want to loose their vote banks. But this is a serious issue and needs to be resolved asap.\ni) Encroachment of footpaths is another reason why padestrians are forced to walk on roads further narrowing the road for traffic vehicles.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

The condition of the main road of Yemalur from Borewell is in a pathetic state since last 2 years now. Every now and then someone comes to dig up the road leaving huge potholes almost everywhere on the road. BBMP puts up a hoarding that the entire stretch will be resurfaced but what happens is only small patchwork which is also pathetic. Where does the entire budget of 13Cr go? The entire stretch is not at all smooth and is very bumpy due to uneven surface giving commuters especially two wheelers back problems. This road has huge traffic due to employees from NAL  ASTE  CABS and EGL making the condition worse.\n\nThe Yemalur road further goes along HAL wall in Kempapura which is completely riddled with potholes. HAL has been approached many times to repair this road but has has no effect till now. BBMP has plans to widen and asphalt this road but this we are hearing since last 4 years. BBMP has even alloted 3Cr for this section of road but there has been no progress on this ever.\n\nCommon man has no choice other than to bear such nonsense and go to their jobs everyday. But it is the BBMP duty to repair and resurface roads properly so that people get a smooth ride. When will this nation change. Corruption is at its peak. No one wants to take up responsibility for their own duties. There is absolutely no accountability!!! \n\nI request BBMP officials to please take note of this and visit this place and access the situation themselves. Though I have no hope posting the complaint on this website but I still wanted to give it a try. We have lost all faith in the system!!!

The road adjacent to Old Airport  between JDA/Thomson Reuters and Kempapura in Yemalur is barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass through when it is in a good condition. Over the past couple of days  however  civic authorities have dug up this road right in the middle  making traffic go haywire. If common sense had prevailed  this digging work should have been done in the night when there is no traffic  and gotten over with in the morning. Office goers and children in school buses get stuck in this stretch for hours  just because some lazy contractor is not doing his job well. My fear is  after the digging is over  they would leave the road un-repaired for months which has been in the case in the past. Could someone responsible look into this please?,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages

I am resident of 2nd Cross  8th Main  BEML Layout  Thubrahalli. Our layout is a well planned residential area comprising of private houses. My home is surrounded by 4 empty plots. All these plots are not monitored by the owners and hence a huge amount of unwanted bushes and weeds have grown into those areas. These bushes now are separate residential quarters for humongous mouses and lethal snakes. Like these there are many empty plots in this area. In last 2 weeks  4 different snakes have been spotted including snakes looking like pythons to rat and cobra in front of my house. This weekend one of the snakes even entered my premise. My landlady said that she is not having any idea about the plot owners as they have been long gone from India. Please provide us with a solution to this and facilitate the area by cleaning these empty plots and catching the snakes before someone gets bitten by those snakes.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

The underpass at the jayadeva hospital is one of the worst as the tyres of my car got spliced astonishingly. My brand new front & Rear tyre of one side got cut rendering them unusable. It happened right as you enter the underpass tunnel and not the ramp. The road is so bad that it you can\'t drive anywhere - left or right the same potholes are visible. If i had taken a different direction i think i would require a full car service. The pain was both tyres deflated hence making me helpless by the side of the road.

Why should the buyer pay for the bags as it is the shop owners responsibility to provide carry bags or have door delivery service even for the smallest of the materials.Shopping mall are no less by charging even for paper bags.Why because ban is only on plastic bags.Entire country is being cheated but no one is interested to resolve this issue.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Dear BTP team  \n\nI understand that managing traffic in Bangalore is a highly stressful job  but you need to understand that driving through this traffic is equally stressful for us if not more.\n\nthis morning  I was waiting at a red light near Udupi Garden Signal (the new signal near Laddoos) and a bike hit into my car bumper. I got out to assess the damage and take a picture of the bike number plate and the light turned green. The policeman on duty  instead of helping out  is standing and shouting at us without even offering to come and help or enquire about what happened. \n\nI understand that holding up traffic is not acceptable but the police are not just here to manage traffic flow and must also assist when an incident occurs. Its quite sad that while the car is damaged by a bike  I have to be shouted at by a cop and made to feel like I am in the wrong. Its hard enough to get from one place to another in this city  we don\'t need the cops excusing bad driving that cause damage to our vehicles just to move traffic along.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Every week BBMP workers (ward 32) arrive with their brooms  clean up the roads  precipitate the dried leaves and disposed wrappers on to the outer periphery of the road and set fire. The practice has been long enough as old as 8 years. No action about proper disposal has taken place since then  or it may be that people have become increasingly careless about the environment. Does one know that burning plastic causes cancer and breathing disorders for the entire neighborhood and the surrounding areas? I provide this link: http://www.carahealth.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=228%3Athe-danger-of-burning-plastic-&catid=218%3Abreast-cancer&Itemid=221&lang=en in creating awareness. As our windows face the colony we receive large amounts of toxic fumes every week. It is painful to know the ill-effects of toxic smoke and continue to breathe the same for the entire day. I hope the authorities take charge in spreading awareness and ensuring proper disposal of waste.,Sweeping of road,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Garbage not lifted from municipal market

Crossing the Outer Ring Road at Kamanahalli Signal is equivalent to Attempting Suicide. There is a Signal and once a while it becomes red to stop vehicles to allow the movement of pedestrians but no vehicles stop and they speed through the Red Signal . Pedestrians have to run for their lives else get hit by the speeding cabs or trucks. With a population more than 1 billion why is the traffic planned not including pedestrians  are we not Human Beings . The Department in charge of this should be made to cross the roads as pedestrians to understand the seriousness of the issue.

I am working in Manyata tech park since one year. I have been staying in PG near Manyata. I don\'t really know if you consider this. But we are facing lot of issues from PG owners. There are no proper rules..they just change them whenever they want. Forget about quality of food but the question is about safety and respect for us. The Pg owner is shouting at girls who ask for advance and today I have seen a girl who is being ill-treated by the owner and her roommates  just to make her leave the pg and go..so her roommates will get their friend to her room. He is forcing and scolding her with un-parlimentary words. Just because we are far from our homes and alone in your state..we are facing this. The girl is being tortured..and I dont really know where will this be end-up and who will take the responsibility if something happens to her. The same pg owner and his relatives are having maximum pg\'s in the area..and they are robbing away advances and not returning back properly and more over they are behaving like dogs..

Dear Sir  A speed-braker has been installed at new thippasandra  II main road  near rama temple. The speed-braker is very un-scientific and very high. It causes eveyone to stop the vehicle instead of slowing. This results in traffic jams many times. For 2 wheelers  it is a big problem as the vehicle can slip. It is also difficult for people particularly Sr  citizens to cross the road. One of the sr. citizen has even failed down. This speed-braker has become a bottleneck on this road. It may result into an accident anytime  as traffic at this point stops completely  but traffic at perpendicular road is fast. Kindly inspect and remove this killer speed-braker. You can install a normal speed braker. Thanks  Avinash Chinchwadkar,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Mosquito nuisance,Hawkers

A few meters later he blocked our car and started hitting and almost breaking the car window. By husband pulled the car window and he started hitting my husband and hurling abuses at us for no reason.\n\nHe just wouldn\'t listen and blocked the entire traffic and just kept beating my husband over and over again.

About 80% of the streetlights in the BDA underpass on Outer Ring Road near BEL circle are not functioning plunging the area into darkness every night. Being an important road to the airport  vehicles travel at high speeds and I\'ve personally witnessed several accidents taking place. Added to this are the potholes and poor patch work done by the BDA on the service roads making driving a very unpleasant experience. If the roads to the international airport are of such poor quality  I can imagine how bad the other city roads are. The authorities concerned are requested to repair the streetlights immediately.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Students studying in Citizen High School donâ€™t walk on the road to reach their school. They are forced to step into potholes.\n\nOne can see only potholes on the 12th cross Sagayapuram road  whose asphalt has been chipped over two years ago. As if the pathetic road conditions were not enough  garbage  irregular parking and severe congestion during peak hours add to the woes of the students.\n\nThe Sagayapuram road is a very narrow stretch. Even though a thin footpath exists  it is encroached by push cart vendors on one side and people park their vehicles on the other  despite it being a â€˜No parkingâ€™ zone.\n\nThe issues are worse during the rainy season with water collecting in the potholes  and garbage floating in it making the entire area messy.\n\nThis road was adopted by the school students under the Bala Janaagraha programme  and for over two years they are trying to get the attention of the authorities concerned towards their problems.\n\nThe school Student Coordinator Tahseen tells IChangeMyCity  that their efforts have not yielded any positive outcome.\n\nSome months ago  the BBMP came forward to lay concrete on the road but the people in the area protested against the concretisation  as they wanted the road to be asphalted. With the authorities and residents not coming to a consensus  it is the students who are facing the brunt  she says.\n\nTahseen further adds that the butcher shops situated right across the school dump waste on the road. However  through the IChangeMyStreet programme  in which the students actively took part  they managed to convince the vendors to stop throwing garbage. Though many of the vendors complied  garbage issues have reduced but not completely disappeared  she says.\n\nTraffic congestion is another main issue  mainly caused by irregular parking. A traffic policeman manning traffic near the school during peak hours would help a lot  point out the school authorities.\n\nYou can help students of Citizen High School have better facilities in the area. All you have to do is vote on the complaint posted by them. Your vote will help draw the attention of the civic agencies and peopleâ€™s representatives  and perhaps make them understand the intensity of the issue.

What prompted me to write this rejoinder is the news published in The New Indian Express  Bengaluru Edition  dated 19-09-2016 (Monday) on page 02 giving the credit to one Sangeeta Bora and S Lalitha with a head line â€œTHE TIME FOR CHANGE IS NOWâ€ with a table of â€œCost of processing is higher than what you payâ€\nI thought and believed that investigative journalism is a passion to find the truth. But today is not a profession or passion but the amount on the cheque that comes before 7th of the month that to make sure the â€œreportersâ€ will go to any extent which earned a nick name as â€œpresstitutesâ€ (I hope it is a parliamentary word being used by the minister). I am attaching scanned copies of BWSSBâ€™s bill for my residential complex for the month of June 2016.\nWhen the table claims â€œCost at which the BWSSB supplies it to residence across Bengaluru is just Rs.7 per Kl (Kilo litre)â€ the Cost of â€œproducingâ€ ( wow  BWSSB can â€œproduceâ€ water?) one Kl of water including pumping and electricity charges is a whopping Rs.30. Means BWSSB subsidize Rs.23 per Kl. What a magnanimous attitude and philosophy?\nOur bill shows an amount of Rs.20630.00 has been billed for a consumption of 215 Kl of water. Grab the calculator (on your â€œsmart phoneâ€) and see that it is Rs 95.95 and not Rs.7.00 as published by these two journalists.  Now you may argue that it contains various other charges viz:-\nWater Charges Rs.4730.00\nMeter Charges Rs.1500.00\nSanitary Charges Rs.7200.00\nSur Charge for Bore well Rs.7200.00\nOk  Just for argument sake divide Rs.4730.00 by 215 Kl comes to Rs.22.00 and not Rs.7.00 as published by TNIE. The actual is 314% higher than what the two ladies of TNIE try to tell its readers.\nMeter Charges. The meter is a part of the â€œhardwareâ€ which was supplied by BWSSB in 2003. After 160 months BWSSB collected Rs.2 40 000.00 as rental for a meter that cost just close to Rs.4000.00.\nOn the back page of the bill it says Sanitary Charges is calculated as 25% of the water supply charges per month for consumption above 8 Kl. So what is the 25% of Rs.4730.00? My calculator says it is Rs.1182.50. Then why Rs.1500.00 (I also checked the bill of August and found that 25% of Rs.4168.00 is also Rs.1500.00/? Why?\nThe bore well was dug  installed a 16 stage submersible pump  powered through a control panel  and energy bill being paid by us. Our residential complex has 72 apartments and therefore Rs.100.00 per flat. That makes Rs.7200.00 per month with no investment/maintenance/repair or energy bill being paid by BWSSB. Why?\nOur residential complex was designed and plumbed making just one connection in the kitchen per apartment. Rest of the requirement is drawn from the bore well.\nOur average consumption of BWSSB water per apartment per day is 84.78 liters  which means a family of four share just 21.95 litre of BWSSB supplied water. Each family pays Rs.8.99 per day just for 84.78 litre of water and the wise and well informed â€œpresstitutesâ€ say it cost only Rs.7.00 per Kl or just 0.007 paisa per litre.  What a comedy or errors?\nI am giving my cell number  land line number  email address  Aadhar Number  Voters ID  PID and residential address  and the property tax paid receipt as proof of identity. \nI request the Chief Editor/Editor or whoever responsible who approved this report to be published must publish a correction and apologize to the citizens of Bengaluru for cheating them on behalf of the authorities of BWSSB which is the most inefficient public service utility I have seen in my 74 years of life in India or the other 19 countries I have visited. I started reading The Indian Express when I was 12 years old (as my father was an ardent admirer of IE) and am still a subscriber. My only daughter who did PG in mass communication and journalism worked for both TNIE and IE till 2002.\nI am happy that she left the print media which is now reduced to the level beyond any expectation of recovery.\n\nM Ramachandran\nB-202 Shivaranjani Apartments \nITI Layout  BSK-III \nBengaluru-560085\n\nCell:no: 9449851708\nLandline No: 26891708\ne:mail ramu_43 hotmail.com,Shortage of water supply,Contaminated water supply,Leaks in water lines

Hi - Recently tar was laid on 100 ft road (padmanabha nagar to Sri Hari Kalyana Mantapa Road). Existing dividers were gotten rid off and new ones were laid)...  From Mega Mart to Gold\'s Gym ( near Indira Nursing a Home) the divider laid is almost to the ground level. Lot of ppl on either side of this stretch cross the vehicles on the divider to get on to the other side of the toad  thereby causing a huge risk of colliding with vehicles who are travelling on the correct side of the road. When confronted  they ask us to mind our own business. This is a serious issues and before it costs someone their life  authorities have to get proactive and address this issue ASAP.

On last Tuesday I.e. 5th of Jan 2016  night at around 1130pm while I was returning home from Wilson Garden I met with almost fatal accident on the Tippu Sulthan Palace road  just in front of State Bank of Travancore. It was due to a dangerous road cutting that was not repaired. The depression was too dangerous that led to my bike to lose  control and fall on my left side  followed by 2 to 3 metres of skidding. This resulted in grating of my skin on left leg and hand  profuse bleeding  tearing of clothes and footwear. Vehicle (TVS FIERO F2) got very badly damaged on the left side. Moreover I almost fainted for 15 minutes. No one was there on the road to call for help. Later God\'s grace  I slowly regained my strength and slowly carried on home.\nHere the issue is NEGLIGENT REPAIR WORK AND WITHOUT CAUTION BOARD\nAt many hundreds of places in the city this is the case. Bloody concerned loathesome authorities (I have sweared them with all the worst abuses known to man) with their incapability  impotence  inability  negligence  carelessness are directly responsible for these kind of mishaps that would put a common citizen to all sorts of danger and suffering.\nThese idiots should be brought to book and treated recklessly and punished very severely  lest many innocent citizens would keep shedding their blood and sometimes even lives on the roads that are meant for safe travels.\nThe ignorant and corrupted  money minded scoundrels should not be given public works contracts. They do this sort of cheap  dangerous and inferior works to suck out citizens money like leeches (leeches are good!). The ass licking corrupted BBMP and other Government authorities who work with these rascals should be publicly punished. Only then we citizens can rest with a sigh. Else its a daily dangerous lives for us until death (mostly on these roads)\nAt many places stray cows would be feeding on plastic and other dangerous garbage at garbage disposal points. The heartless concerned authorities  instead of fining the owners of these straying animals with huge fines or confiscating the animals ARE DOING NOTHING. WHY SHOULD THESE IDIOTS BE IN POSITION IF THEY CAN\'T DO WHAT THEY ARE PAID FOR.

Though we are all paying a SWM Cess (Solid Waste Management Cess) to the BBMP every year along with our Property Tax  there is NO garbage collection in our area.  The residents of our area are forced to throw their garbage on the side of the road and in the vacant sites in our area.  When I had inquired about the garbage collection  the person who I spoke to over a year ago  told me that there is a tempo assigned to go around collecting the garbage from every house in my area. But  he said  that the tempo had gone for repairs. That was over ONE YEAR ago!   Till date  in the last 2 years  I have not seen anyone coming to our area to collect the garbage.  Can someone please tell me how the residents who are living in my area and in the surrounding area are supposed to dispose of their garbage when there are no dust bins in our area and there is no garbage collection being done?  Please treat this as urgent as this matter has been pending for over two years now and it is only going to get worse unless the BBMP does something to address this issue.

I had posted 4 weeks back  under W0780C43461 that There is a huge collection center in front of St.Joseph\'s school   Promenade Road. Garbage is being burnt here regularly. Minister Roshan Baig stays hardly 100 meters away from this spot. Today  no one could walk on the road nearby as heavy smoke was emanating from the garbabe being burnt again. The security staff in St Francis Convent and St. Johns Church say that the garbage is not collected regularly and the BBMP garbage collectors burn the same. The whole walls are black which is the evidence. Will the Commissioner act now at least and take action ? or simply say that the complaint has been forwarded and we are on the job.

BBMP is once again proving that it cannot complete a project without any problems and the already completed projects are of sub-standard quality. The widening of the HMT watch-factory which was started with much fun-fare is now nothing but an apparent scam. ABout 75% of the work was complete sometime back and now the remaining portion  especially near the BBMP basketball court looks like a warfield in Afghanstan. Footpaths are broken  potholes all over  dust covered trees in the park with absolutely no work going on. Even the 75% of the completed work is of poor quality with several potholes on the stretch. There is an exceptionally big pothole near Brigade Courtyard. The repair of this road was a scam in the previous BJP led government; it is proving to be a scam in the present Congress government as well. BBMP and the local politicians are nothing but leeches; bloodsuckers that force people to pay tax money and provide sub-standard infrastructure like this.

Hi      I work for Nokia Networks in Manyata Tech Park  Nagavara  Bangalore. As part of signal free traffic  a lot of flyovers and underpasses have been made in the Outer Ring road from Silk Board to Hebbal. But despite all these progressive implementations  the situation infront of Manyatha Tech Park is really bad since the past couple of months. The whole free flowing traffic comes and gets congested infront of the bus stops infront of the tech park because of the high number of employees going into and out of the tech park. Not only is this causing traffic block but its putting the life of the many people at risk  who are crossing the roads at all times of the day. During peak traffic hours there are security guys being deployed to stop vehicles on either sides for pedestrian crossing. There are more than a lakh of employees working in Manyatha Tech park and construction of a foot over-bridge infront of it seems like the best option to resolve this issue. Not only will it help in safe guarding the lives of the people but it will help reduce the traffic bottle-neck in the Ring road.    Please look into this issue.

ICMYC had also given me BBMP Officer Mr. Sathyanarayana\'s phone no. 9480684222 to contact him and resolve the issue. But after repeated trials I was not able to connect to him  the number does not exist. I had informed to ICMYC through phone calls  comments  emails and whatsapp about the non-existent phone number. But ICMYC was unable to provide any support and additionally I have received at least 10 phone calls from Janagraha asking about the status of the issue. This is a humble request that do not just call us to know whether the issue is resolved or not  kindly do not be so target oriented. Please try to identify and work on the blockages or hurdles that the person is facing in resolving the issue. If you do not have a solution  kindly tell the same.

Dear Sir \n\nBeing the Resident of BTM 1st Stage 12th Main  i have a huge concern about Sanitation. In a due course the BBMP has no concern about the Garbage collection in & around the other mains of BTM 1st Stage. \n\nYou can see Garbage lying around the area all over. People tend to keep their garbage in front of others house when no one is around   the Nyt. It is really bad & we are really worried.\n\nThe garbage collection lady appointed by BBMP comes as and when she wishes to come. She even collects Rs.50pm from almost every house. She openly asks for money & when we say about here whereabouts she never turns up to your place. And she never sweeps the streets where only dry leaves are fallen from the trees. It is really annoying sir.\n\nDue to this lots of Mosquitoes & house flies have started troubling us. Itz not only about the 12th Main  all over BTM is suffering with this problem. Sometimes we forcibly have to dispose the garbage we have to place it somewhere near the parks & roadside   Nyt. Itz my sincere request to take up this matter & do the needful for the betterment of Bangalore.\n\nI wish & hope my request is considered & taken up further\n\nRegards \n\nAbhijit Kadam\n9845853518,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Sweeping of road

The Sankey\'s road stretch from just after Sankey\'s Tank entrance to Bashyam circle is always crowded in the mornings between 9 to 10 due to the volume of traffic. Many car drivers and motorists jump the queue drive in the wrong lane and try entering just before the barricade starts a few meters before bashyam circle signal. Few motorists continue to drive on the wrong side till the signal at times end up being caught by the traffic cop at the signal. \nThe car drivers who wait in the queue look like fools waiting while many others drive past them in the wrong lane and try to force themselves in just before the barricade. Also this chokes the incoming traffic and thereby creating a longer duration to move past the signal. \nUrge the authorities to place 2 other cops in that stretch and not allow drivers to drive in the wrong lane or put barricades through the stretch. \nThanks!,Bad Patches,"Removal of silt from nalla across culverts, etc.",Person falling in Manhole

3 months ago  as soon as rainy season started   BWSSB came and dug up our road to replace drain pipes. In the process  they damaged Kaveri water pipes.

We cannot get our car inside the compound since the water pipe is in front of the gate and they have not got it covered.

I had parked my vehicle within alloted parking space at the end of it. Someone wanted to park their bike and pushed my bike away. Issue to note that there was no line limit for parking except for a pole which said parking. Police towed away my bike saying it was in no parking. When enquired hed told that the pole was the Limit. When i explained to him that some one else had pushed my bike away he told to take a photograph instead while parking or get the person who pushed your bike. He also told that this is India so we cant implement cctv and for your justice. And parking fine for first time is only 100 which i should have to reluctant to pay cos nothing was my mistake but i dint want to argue. Instead he charged 300 for it and gave a receipt for 200rs. When i complained about the issue to the concerned police station they told that you got to talk to ACP or DCP  we cant do anything in this matter. I challenged them that i would take pic of police vehicle in no parking and show it to you then what would you do. The police guy had no answer for it. I also showed him a police van in no parking but he just shook it apart.

While garbage collection from individual houses is regular  there is a huge garbage dumping problem. Empty plots and rainwater gutters have become regular dumping grounds for all sorts of garbage - plastic  food  debris from construction. Some of this dumping is done by construction workers who are temporary residents in this area  but I am not sure who else is to blame for throwing this garbage. An area which was once pleasant to walk in is now \'decorated\' with such waste on almost all lanes.,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Collection point not attended properly,Garbage not lifted from house gully

My street is facing the problem of open gutters and no sewage drains for a long time. Most of the streets in my area has both closed gutters and sewage drains  except 2 to 3 streets including mine. There is no place for the sanitary water to drain properly  it gets flushed back to the houses. Due to this many houses open up their sanitary connection to the open gutters. The whole street stinks very badly. Kids fall sick very often. They have been suffering from vomiting and diarrhea often. No proper drainage system  no closed gutter  and no proper road. All this has led to more mosquitoes. Some of the people were affected by Dengue too. Nothing has worked out even after complaining to the concerned authority  Kindly solve our problem and help us live a healthy life.,Drainage chokes and blockages,Overflowing drains or manholes,Odour  foul smell  from drains

My complaint is about the recent installations of loudspeakers in S.G Palya ( Near Shri Nivas theater )  on the eve of a festival  where temples have installed loudspeakers everywhere on the nearby buildings. They don\'t take anyone\'s permission  as they the politicians here provide them full support. The residents never complain out of fear from the involvement of politicians and other powerful people.  \nThey leave the loudspeakers  running in high volume  continuously from morning till evening. It\'s hard to stand walk nearby or even concentrate on the traffic on the busy roads. The noise is so high that it feels as if the head will burst out.  \nAlmost every 1-2 months  the loudspeakers are installed  and people living nearby suffer. Kindly ask the related authority to stop this nuisance. \n\nPS:  I see so many similar complaints here on Ichangemycity.com. But it seems that no complain ever works. What is the use of taking a complaint  if it happens regularly  again and again ? Even if you solve my complaint... it would happen somewhere else again..

I am from Foyer Infinity Apartments in ITPL  Pattandur Agrahara Road. Just next to the land adjacent to our apartment  there are single room sheds made for rent. Approximately 100 people live there in various sheds. There is not even single toilet made for them. All of these people have a bath  wash utensils outdoor next to a well  they even do all their other Sanitary work in outdoors. As a result there is a huge swamp and garbage dump made out of their bathing water  toilet etc. This swamp stinks and is the breeding ground for mosquitos. It can easily lead to diseases like Dengue and Malaria. I am surprised no action has been taking against the landowner for not providing a toilet for these residents while he is merrily getting rent from them.

The road was dug to clear the drainage blocking. Its left unrepaired. Why cant there be a manhole with a lid instead. The road is being dug every few months. The sewage removed from the drain is not cleared properly and is left there. Which finally goes into the same drain. It has a very bad foul smell since many days. This will very much lead to spreading of dengue if left like this. I request BWSSB to take immediate action. The drain blockage is mainly because of two hotels- who just dump the waste.

It takes about 30 min just to start from anywhere inside Ecospace to reach main exit during peak hours  and vice versa. And its just about 200 to 500 meters distance. All these are because of faulty Ecospace design with all main entrance/exit towards ORR  also contributing to ORR traffic which is already bad. Ecospace is one main contributor for ORR traffic in bellandur.     As shown in attached diagram  I propose multiple entry/exit in Ecospace  so people from different direction can go/come in that direction  rather than all accumulating towards ORR. There are some roads very near to Ecospace compound.     On proposed south west exit  co operation from Bangalore Lake department is needed to use that road  that goes alongside the lake. With people co-operation  a win-win situation could surely be arrived  for both commuters and lake department without affecting the lake anyway.    On  proposed south east exit  a small portion of land comes in between NR layout and Ecospace. Here too  instead of land acquistion  the owner could be consulted to arrive at win-win situation. For eg  Ecospace could pay a monthly amount  say Rs.50k to owner for using this portion of land. As can be seen from satellite image  this land is currently barren. Instead land owner could be encouraged to support for this cause  and also could be getting a lump monthly income. Ecospace could charge this across companies  so it would not be costly affair for them at all.     All that is required is pro active   open minded  co operative initiative from RMZ and near by land authorities  with govt body acting as catalyst.   Distributed traffic is the key.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

At new tipsandra  4th c cross  agency do not come regularly to pick the garbage and road sweep is very irregular. When i contacted the agent on his mobile: 9611676155. He told that the staffing issue. And garbage pickup vehicle has not come from last 10 days and if you ask him he says vehicle is under repair. The sweepers who come to the cleaning only in front of those house who pay money to them. (Some time they collect money from others as well and do not do it properly)They do not do their duty properly. In this regard i brought to the notice of counselor but he/she said that they are going to change the agency. But still the issue is not resolved. Here concern is we pay betterment tax  etc.. all taxes but why not the concerned people take necessary actions. attached photos for reference. I personally spoke to the area incharge and he says alternate days. But even if it is alternate days if they have come on monday they are supposed to come on wednesday. But they have not come as wednesday is weekly holiday. Agency take huge money from the tax payers and not provided with the better service.

BBMP constructs sheds on pavement for vegetable vendors\n\nOn September 8  2014 the High Court warned of taking stringent action against the BBMP engineers for failing to implement the courtâ€™s earlier orders to make the Cityâ€™s footpaths user friendly. These orders seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Let alone following the orders  the BBMP has violated it by constructing sheds on a pavement to house vendors.\n\nSome of these pictures of footpaths stand testimony to the fact that the Palike engineers have not paid heed to the Courtâ€™s directions neither in the past nor now. \n\nMore than two years ago Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) demolished the Seshadripuram Fruits & Vegetable Market owned by it to construct a shopping complex. This BBMP market is more than sixty years old. It housed the vegetables  fruits and chicken and mutton stall separately. It was constructed such that anyone entering the market would not be able to see the mutton and chicken stalls unless they were directly headed to it. Now all these displaced vendors were provided with newly constructed cement sheds by the BBMP on the wide pavement on either side of the Seshadripuram park entrance. The sheds occupied half the width of the pavement. \n\nVery soon after relocating to the sheds the vendors renovated the sheds and have extended it to cover the entire width of the footpath and they display their ware on the road. Many of the sheds now serve as their dwelling units. They have also encroached about 20-30 feet of the busy road. To add to this vehicles are also parked parallel to it. This is diagonally opposite Seshadripuram college and the Swastik bus stop.\n\nThe mutton shop and chicken shop have been provided sheds on the pavement next to the Seshadripuram Post office. Geetha Devi  a resident in this area since the last forty years says that whenever she has to pass on this road she has to cover her nose due to the smell and also there are a lot of stray dogs around and one has to be careful when walking on this stretch or entering the post office. These shops dump their waste behind their shop. (Wonder why the Seshadripuram Post Master allowed these to come up opposite their office)\n\nCrows and kites carry this waste onto terraces of the houses in the vicinity  polluting rain water harvesting systems.  Dogs come here to feed on the waste. All these stray dogs pose a danger to the pedestrians and school children and also early morning walkers in the adjacent Seshadripuram Park.\n\nThis is a very busy area  vehicles ply on both directions in spite of it being one way.\nGod only should save the pedestrians - thousands of them because of the Seshadripuram day college  school and evening college.\n\nTwo wheelers and cars are parked at the Seshadripuram  bus stop near college on the footpath and also on the road. At Swastik Circle it is very bad Trinity Isle Hotel has converted footpath into parking lot for four wheelers within the footpath railings. Pedestrians are forced to walk on the road. In front of Swastik hotel  footpath railings are removed and parking allowed. The Seshadripuram Police station is diagonally opposite.\n\nRamanan a resident of the area says that whenever Traffic Police / Hoysala come they ignore the vehicles parked on footpaths. He says  â€œAs senior citizens we cannot even dare to go to the park for our walk for fear of being knocked down. Already many people here have met with accidents.â€\n\nPhoto captions:\n\nPix 1: A heavy vehicle parked right on the pavement next to the Swastik bus stop.\n\nPix 2: The newly constructed sheds on the pavement in front of Seshadripuram College.\n\nPix 3:  The entrance to the park is sandwiched between these sheds.\n\nPix 4: The vendors who have occupied a portion of the road to display their wares.\n\nPix 5: All sorts of vendors have now occupied the footpath after these sheds were constructed by the BBMP.\n\nPix 6 & 7: A pavement that has been modified to facilitate parking within the footpath railings at Swastik Circle  forcing pedestrians to walk on road endangering themselves.\nPedestrians cannot climb the elevated footpath.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Hawkers,Drainage chokes and blockages

Right on the 18th cross road Parangpalya  HSR layout sector 2 there is a huge population of stray pigs.

A bad smell emanates in this area because of this and I need to keep my window of my flat closed. Pigs are known to spread diseases and I request authority to remove these pigs from this area. Just opposite we have a udipi hotel also where people eat food sometimes bearing the stink of the pigs. I come from a place called Palani where once there used to be huge population of pigs. They were a menace there spreading diseases biting people especially small children.

The drainage system in Avenue road (KR Market â€“ Mysore Bank Junction) has been clogged from the past few years.\n\nThis has not been cleared regularly; the drains are not able to withstand even a small rain. Recently when there was a shower on 3rd March 2015  all the rain water was flowing on the street instead of flowing inside the drains.\n\nOne of the reasons for garbage accumulation in the drains is due to uneven and broken footpath stones. \n\nThe BBMP should take this matter on priority basis and see to it that the footpaths stones are replaced with new even stones and it also has to ensure that all the clogs have to be removed on priority basis before another Rain hits Bengaluru.\n\nIn reality Avenue Road even though is only 1.1km long  it falls in three corporatorsâ€™ jurisdiction but  not even one of them is showing interest in this.

Thank you BBMP for giving Hutchins Road the status of the \'Worst Road in Bengaluru\'. It is a fine example of how your department can ruin a road. There are no words for explaining the situation of the condition of the road. \n\nOne fine day (2 Months Back) BBMP or BWSSB thought of bringing a big Earth digger to a narrow road and start digging to lay pipes. They completed one section (if you call it completed) and thought they would continue with the same slow pace. Right at the junction of Hutchins Road and North Road they stopped. I guess they didn\'t know what else to do. In this process they even broke the compound wall of Hutchins Corner Apartment. The entire stretch is now dusty and cannot be used to drive or ride properly. You cannot even walk without feeling as if you have crossed a big desert and spoilt your clothes with all that dust. \nThis situation has been for the last 2 months without any progress. Everybody is frustrated with no information on whether BBMP will finish this work or make us suffer everyday.\n\nThe manhole on top of the drain at the junction of Hutchins road and Davis road has been made so brilliantly that one auto rickshaw drives over it and it broke. Now we can see gutter water about to overflow anytime soon. \n\nThe gutter covers on the right side of the road had caved in at least a year back and till date it is still lying like that. Maybe BBMP is waiting for someone to fall and hurt themselves during night and to make our job easier of getting hurt the street lights also don\'t work most of the time. \n\nIf this is how BBMP wants to improve Bengaluru then God only can save this city.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

I am writing this letter to request the concerned departments to start mini bus services in the old city area of Bengaluru. Firstly  the good work of police needs to be acknowledged for their action taken in Avenue Road  enabling senior citizens to use the footpaths\n\nNow coming back to the point  I would like to request you to start mini bus facility in the old city area to help the pedestrians and commuters. I would like to bring to your notice that a trial had been carried out with regular bus in Avenue road sometime back and this exercise was successful as the bus was able to go from City Market Junction to Mysore Bank Junction.\n\nWith the introduction of mini bus  there would less private vehicular traffic in these areas and pedestrians using the footpath can also benefit from this move. This would also help in reining in errant auto drivers who charge more than the meter rate  an example for this is the auto drivers in Chickpet circle  Avenue road.\n\nThe suggested route with stops could be City Market  Gundopanth Street  Chickpet Circle  Mysore Bank Junction  BVK Iyengar Road Cross  Shantala Silk House  Brand Square  St.Josephâ€™s High School and finally back to City Market Junction.\n\n1) Gundopanth Street facilitates commuters to go to SP Road  SJP Road  \n2) Chickpet Circle is heart of the city and centre point to visit all important business establishments in the old city area\n3) Mysore Bank Junction is near to Kaveri Bhavan  Vidhan Soudha and Dodda Ballapur Bus Stop\n4) BVK Iyengar Road Cross is near to Majestic \n5) Shantala Silk House is close to the upcoming metro station  bus stand and also the railway station\n\nThe BMTC can take up a feasibility study with regards to this and personally I feel that this operation would be feasible for the BMTC with able support from the Police Department and BBMP.,Unauthorised Stalls on Roads,Removal of rank regulation on roads,Running without licence

Silk Board Junction has turned out to be a nightmare for commuter\'s. Everyday we see huge traffic pile up especially in the evening. The major reason for this is the unorganized traffic signals in the Outer ring road and silk board junction. After HSR flyover towards silkboard you will end up waiting in 2-3 signals and silk board green signal time is so inadequate that the traffic can never end. Traffic control team should increase the Green signal time according to the traffic in the different directions and according to peak timings. There is no point in having same time for all the four side signals.

Pl.note maxi cabs are unauthorisedly parked on the main road just near the signal of BTM layout 29th cross in front of Axa Business services.  Vehicles coming from 29th cross taking left turn towards Silk board face difficulties as the cabs are parked both side of the road haphazardly affecting movement of vehicles. Currently Kuvempu nagar bmtc bus station which is just opposite to 29th cross is under renovation and even BMTC buses are parked on the road side of this cross further affecting the traffic movement.  There is a foot path side hotel at the signal and most of the BMTC drivers park here to have their breakfast/lunch/dinner.  The vehicles have to go on the right side of the road dangering their lives from oncoming opposite side vehicles as the legal lane is occupied by the unauthorised parking.  There will not only a police constable but traffic inspector also present most part of the day and inspite of huge jam created due to this parking they are not bothered and this will increase our suspicion on Traffic police also join hands with the cab owners/drivers for such unauthorised parking.  request the concern to immdtly look into the matter and take suitable steps,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Unauthorised construction development,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain"

Problem 1: Kaikondrahalli Junction: Traffic from Kasavanahalli road cannot take right towards Wipro and is asked to take left and an immediate U turn. Its a narrow U-Turn that blocks traffic on both sides and creates Chaos  Solution: Remove medians near Kabab Mandra and Purva Sunshine Appartment. Let the U-Turn be taken near the Fire station. Its a wide road and easier to navigate. Will not hold up traffic and also allow larger vehicles to easily pass through  Problem 2: Bellandur Gate (Sarjapur Road) - Traffic from Harlur is not allowed right turn. Traffic moves left and takes U-Turn that again blocks the traffic.   Solution: Remove the median let all traffic take U-Turn at Sarjapur junction signal. Traffic wanting U-Turn can do the same near the Harlur Junction manned by Traffic cops/ORR helpers  Problem 3: St. John's signal on Sarjapur Road. BMTC buses terminating here cause chaos trying to take a U-Turn holding up the traffic.  Solution  : All BMTC buses terminating at St. John's should take left at water tank towards Hosur road and come to St. John's following the signal. Will avoid the chaos.    These are simple solutions if implemented will help in smooth flow of traffic.

Dear BBMP    Street light from HAL Signal to HAL Post Office is not working. Footpath condition is already pretty bad and if street light also does not work  then it increases chances of falling and injuries.     Its a stretch of more than 300 Meters and everyday 1000's of people walk on this stretch to go toward LB Shastry/Annasandarpllya Area.

Sir   I am writing this mail seeking the help  of BBMP Health Inspector/ BBMP officer of J C Nagar  Bangalore 560006. Next to our house on the left side  a hotel was started named Kavitha  Tiffen Room. In the beginning  they used to do business only inside the premises. But now they have sublet the Hotel to another person named Mr Madiraj. He has encroached the entire footpath. He is doing cooking and serving food on the footpath instead of using the premises i.e Kavitha Tiffen Room. They are using this place as their storeroom.  In the morning from 6.30 AM to 12.00 noon and in the evening from 6.00 PM to 12.30 PM they will be doing business on the footpath. His customers eat on the footpath  wash their hands  spit and make the entire area dirty. His customers even come front of our gate and house  eat and make it dirty. They put plastic papers from the plate  paper bits after wiping their hands  they spit  wash their hands  put food waste  clean their nose  vomit and do all nuisance on the footpath and front of our house. He and his workers push all the waste i.e  minimum of 2 to 3 kgs daily under the footpath drain. It is a disturbance for the neighbours. All vehicles of his customers will be parked in front of our house.  We cannot even come out. It is very difficult for senior citizen  to get into an auto or get down.  Full vehicles will be blocked. While cooking and serving he will be banging on the tava with metal spoons till 12.30 PM in the night making egg burgies etc. They make so much noise even after 10.00 PM. There are children and senior citizen in our house. They cannot sleep because of this disturbance. I requested Mr Madiraj to de  his hotel business inside and not to dirty the footpath and front  of our house  I told him that if he continue creating problem for us  I will complain to BBMP.  He is a dirty person and makes the entire place dirty.  They eat and put the waste there only. He has challenged me that go and complain to BBMP or Police  he is not bothered as he is giving bribe to them regularly. he does not respect BBMP and is not scared of BBMP. He says that even if BBMP come and remove his tables  etc.  again within half an hour he will put it back  nobody can do anything for him. He is a very strong person. He is having another hotel just 2 minutes from this place.\nSir  I kindly request you to help us by taking action against him  remove him permanently from the footpath and cancel the license of this hotel to do business on footpath and he should not make the footpath or road dirty and not disturb neighbours. Even if it rains heavily for 5 mins this main road will be flooded and water will enter our house. Last year only BBMP laid new road and footpath and this man pushes the waste daily under the footpath drain.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Hawkers,Drainage chokes and blockages

It gets worse when it rains as the driver of the car cannot predict the road and its condition.

Trail of the latest complaints to Old Airport Road Police Station and other Senior Police Officers on the issue is copied below. It amply explains everything in the matter -\n\nDear Officer In-charge \nAirport Police Station  Bangalore \n&\nother Senior Police Officers copied on this mail.\nPlease refer to the trail mails and my stream of real time messages through Twitter and mails  with photos and videos of loud and noisy program  that went on unabated yesterday i.e. the 28th August \' 16 from 01.00 PM to 10.00 PM  at Hotel Royal Orchid  Next to KGA Golf Course  Kodiahalli  Old Airport Road.\nIt is unfortunate and disappointing that despite our preemptive mails and intimations  to you and other Police Authorities  no action seems to have been taken. Hotel Royal Orchid remained defiant as always. \n\nThere is no doubt it is a cognisable and preventable offence under law. It is your bounden duty to enforce this law as well. No body denies Hotel\'s right to do business. But a right to do business must be exercised within the restrictions and limitations under law necessary to protect rights of others. They can not forget that they are running business in an area surrounded by Residences. \n\nIf you feel mine and requests of other Residents to prevent violation of Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules 2000 and directives of Honâ€™ble. Karnataka High Court and Honâ€™ble. Supreme Court on the issue are not proper then please say so with your justifications. We will look for other remedies.\n\nSo far your indifference and inaction have been very disappointing for us and encouraging for the defiant Hotel. For us it is an ongoing perpetual problem. \n\nI am also disappointed to find that after complaining to you  I receive a call from the Hotel. I had received a call from Mobile No.- +919902030203 purportedly from the Hotel on 27.08.2016 at 19.42 Hrs. which purposefully I did not answer.

Karnataka High Court and Honâ€™ble. Supreme Court on the issue. \n\nIt is not in dispute that noise level in a Residential Area during Night Time can not go beyond 45 dB(A) Leq. (equivalent to the sound of a Home Fridge) and the same during Day Time can not go beyond 55 dB(A) Leq. (equivalent to the sound of a Normal Conversation or a Quiet Office).\n\nHotel Royal Orchid  Next to Karnataka Golf Association  Off Old Airport Road  Kodiahalli  Bangalore is surrounded by Residential Areas in very close vicinity. Residential Flats in Blocks â€“ â€˜Aâ€™ to â€˜Iâ€™ of the Diamond District are directly exposed to this Hotel which is at a meagre distance of within 50 Meters  with just a small common boundary wall between them.  \n\nHotel Royal Orchid has been a habitual violator of the Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules 2000 and directives of Honâ€™ble. Karnataka High Court and Honâ€™ble. Supreme Court on the issue. Repeatedly they conduct noisy and very loud Concerts  Music Programs and Parties in their open lawns  exposed to the above Residential Flats of the Diamond District. My repeated complaints as well as repeated complaints of other Residents to you and other Senior Police Officers through Phones  E-Mails and Tweets  in the past  are the testimony.\n\nNow  this mail is preemptive and preventive in nature  based on our past bad experiences  the trail mails with this mail and the Web Link given in the trail mail. Apparently  Hotel Royal Orchid is proposing to have a Jazz Music Concert on the next Sunday i.e. on the 28th Augustâ€™ 2016.

Karnataka High Court and Honâ€™ble. Supreme Court on the issue. If it so happens  definitely it will again be much to the discomfort  disappointment and chagrin of the nearby and adjacent Residents.\n\nI do not know if any permission is granted in such case or has been granted in this case. But in case it is done or has been done  it must be withdrawn and be not granted forthwith  as it is in violation of Law  Rules and Court directions.\n\nI seek your help in the matter and take appropriate preemptive as well as preventive measures.\n\nThanks Galore & with Warm Regards !\n\nPravin Kishore Prasad \nIndian Revenue Service (Ci-devant) \nEx.

First they put stones (Jellykallu)  after 1 month they applied tar which was incomplete. till hanging garden place they laid the tar after that till main road (which connects Veerannapalya) is still stone road which was never flattened. Because of daily usage of vehicles made the road flat  some what better to travel. \nThey is no other go other than to use this pathetic road. Is this the way BBMP do the construction.

"I am writing on behalf of 1400+ Residents of Sobha Amethyst (attached as google link  signatures ~ 300+ families) who are living in constant fear due to the ILLEGAL Telecom Tower installed by American Tower Corporation (ATC) in extremely close proximity to us. This huge Tower (150 - 200 ft) is a major health hazard and has caused widespread anguish and anxiety among our residents. The perils of electromagnetic radiations on humans the lesser told the better.    This was primarily installed for Bharti Airtel  and now all the major player like Vodafone  BSNL Reliance have their services attached.     Refer to the News Story published on Page#3 in The Times of India dated September 18th  2014. (attached as google link)    The ILLEGAL status of this ATC Tower has been confirmed by the following departments in response to RTI queries (attached as google link) filed by us.   Â·        Gram Panchayat  Dodabanahalli  Ministry of Rural Development.  Â·         Department of Telecommunication (DOT)  Ministry of Information and Technology  Â·         Standing Advisory Committee on Radio Frequency Allocations (SACFA)  Â·         Karnataka State Pollution Control Board    As per ""ALL"" the above departments  approvals are REQUIRED prior to installation of any tower. Further the RTI says-  ""Installing telecom towers in India is classified as a commercial activity. In this case this has been installed on a GREEN zone  exclusively meant for agriculture purpose. and hence this is been as ILLEGAL ""    We are shocked to see laws have been openly VOILATED. And the government cannot care less  in spite of this getting reported by the media !!  We have complained till the Chief Secretary  leave alone BMP/BDA commissioners. There is absolute SILENSE. We have only one question to the agencies - ""If you state that Tower is ILLEGAL in your RTI  why is there delay in its demolition/relocation ?""    And the best part - now we re being intimidated and threatened by the tower company via series of letters  as to why did we expose them to their clients. Ridiculous  a company illegally installing towers violating all norms  a major health concern for us and salute to their guts that now they threaten us as to why did we  speak up !!     We look for your help and support for our cause. This is not a isolated case.

The level difference of layout road top level and storm water drain bottom level  is about 4\'-0\"". Present situation if there is heavy rain of .5 hour is enough to flood our area with 4\'0\"" storm water. This main drain side wall is constructed up to 19th main after that drain flowing naturally.\nSides are encroached and people are dumping all waste and debris to the side of the drain and it can not accommodate the water coming from other areas.

"Bengaluru traffic was getting on nerves a few days ago. Now it has begun to get into the SPINE AND BRAIN. This is because of a lot of factors like 1.   Unfriendly roads--- Most of the roads have \"" Wells and Valleys\"" in them. Sometimes the humps are like \""Mountains and Cliffs. This might be due to poor asphalt used and poor design. Illegal (many times even legal) road cutting and no patch work. Very crude road patch work  which gives a feel that it was good before. No footpath barriers and hence most of the pavements are ROADS for small vehicles. 2.   Byappanahalli road junction seems to be a \""fun to appreciate city planning\"" authorities. 1000s of vehicles carrying many 1000s of people clog for literally \""HALF TO ONE HOUR\"" causing irritation  disease out of smoke  petty quarrels on the road etc..while a small funny METRO TRAIN carrying hardly 30 to 50 people runs so well.......Should we say HATS OFF TO AUTHORITIES???  Better replace that with a flyover. It would serve a purpose. 3.   The byappanahalli railway junction is another masterpiece of FUN. There is a half done flyover that should be done. Fun is that instead of easing the traffic  it itself has become a cause of road congestion. This is happening since 8 TO 10 years. \""The authorities are blaming each other and escaping from their responsibility.\"" The plight of vehicles from 2 wheelers to 20 wheelers waiting literally for HALF TO EVEN MORE THAN ONE HOUR is really pathetic. If it rains imagine  kids  women and the old-agers on 2 wheelers.....3.   Another great problem is most of the trucks and other vehicles carrying sand  pebbles  garbage  sharp edged iron junk etc.. are allowed to travel without proper LEAK PROOF covering. This is the major cause for road dust leading to respiratory and other problems for road users (both vehicle and walking). The plight of shop keepers by these roads are very much diseased and degraded. Moreover the roads are not regularly cleaned. The cleaning equipment used is age old and literally useless. There should be MORE and more vacuum suckers and other cleaning gear.4) Traffic violators causing unnecessary traffic jams should be punished with very high fine and other punishments.This article is not intended to offend anyone.

The road traffic from Graphite India Signal to ESI junction Whitefield road has converted to one-way a few months back. The dividers(Medians) kept on the middle road were removed to help the flow of traffic. However  the dividers were not completely removed. Two pieces of them are still kept. There are no markings for alerting drivers. The zebra painting is faded into black.     Not Removing This piece of divider is an unfinished job by BBMP. This comes as a surprise for many drivers new to the area and almost a 100 vehicles have crashed into this divider so far. On 23-June-2015  My car crashed into this divider as it's a blind spot. There was also a pothole which forces drivers to change lane. Which is fixed in first week of July 2015.  My car is insured and I claimed my car Insurance. However  beyond insurance pay  I am liable to pay around an estimated cost of 1.5Lakh Indian rupees to the Car Garage.    This unplanned expense came from me due to bad infrastructure and negligence from BBMP work. I kindly request BBMP authority's help in getting a compensation for this unfortunate incident. I also request to complete the divider removal process as soon as possible or keep a warning sign for upcoming traffic.    Speed at the time of incident: 30KMPH.

Parks are closed at 10am in the morning. My child is 5 years old who wakes up early everyday due to school timings. On weekends I prefer her to wakeup late in the morning so that she gets proper sleep. By the time she wakes up its already 9-00am to make her ready we lose another hour or so. Even if we are free to take her to park they are closed due to weird timing. Now they open only by 4-00pm in the evening. So she has to sit at home without any outdoor play.    I stay at Horamavu and I have four or five parks which have these timings. The parks are at Kasturinagar. It would be good to keep the parks open for children to play on weekends atleast.

The traffic jam during peak hours at hosa road junction is almost a daily problrm and needs better and professinal treatment from traffic police. There is a need to put signals for service roads in addition to the main road and strictly prohibit the vehicles and people who who assemble in the middle of the circle below the flyover without caring for signal. Police also should do away with stopping the vehicles crossing the main road to basapura road despite the signal given just to allow the vehicles of main road to pass. The time for signal from main road to basapura road shoud be more as they have to additionally cover the area of flyover area. Many a times multiple manual signals are given for side roads from basapura side causing a mess.

BMTC buses stop right at the Kaikondrahalli traffic signal on the Sarjapur Main Road. This results in a long queue of vehicles behind the buses. So  even if the signal is green  the vehicles can\'t move ahead as the buses stop right at the traffic junction without leaving adequate space for the vehicles behind. This happens on both sides of the road as the BMTC bus stop is right at the junction.\nThe Kaikondrahalli junction sees heavy traffic as this road also connects the locality to E-city via Central Jail Road. On both sides of the road  there is adequate space just 100 mts ahead of the traffic signal (outside Xplode restobar on one side of the road and outside the Kaikondrahalli lake entrance gate on the other side). If the BMTC buses stop at this point  it will ease out a lot of traffic movement at this signal/junction.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

I find that the traffic police operate the Automatic Signal in Cubbon Road - Kamaraj Road Junction and allow the traffic from Cubbon Road side towards Dickenson Road ( Manipal Center) for a long time. \nThis results in traffic piling up on both sides of Kamaraj road and the 2 wheelers coming from Hospital road  St Johns Road side go on the wrong side of the Kamaraj Road and try to join the lane in front of Army Public school. Normally there are more than 50 to 60  two wheelers trying to join near this place. This blocks the traffic on the right lane and people who want to turn right are unable to go. They have to wait for more than 4 or 5 turns for the signal. \nSince  the traffic from Cubbon Road side is always continuous giving them such a long and free time adds to the traffic jam which spills over to the surrounding areas.  The Constables may be suitably advised. This happens from 9.30 am - 11 am,Signals,Speed breakers,Removal of rank regulation on roads

With reference to the above subject  I would like to bring to ur kind information that there are many vacant site in Balaji Krupa Layout  hegdenagar  (Jakkur ward No 5 ) Bangalore 77. Land Owner does not keep the site clean.Also the site is full of plants  weeds and also it has become a breeding place for mosquitoes.During night times the scavengers urinate in this vacant site and it causes stinking smell to the neighbouring houses.The neighbouring houses also dump garbage onto this site.\n\nThese vacant sites have become a big menace as they are seen as haven for poisonous creatures like snakes and scorpios. They also help mosquitoes breed. Now I heard from the newspapers like Deccan Herald that the BBMP has decided to exercise power given to it for the maintenance of vacant sites. As per the Karnataka Municipal Corporation (KMC) Act  it is duty of the owners to keep the sites clean but if they fail the municipal bodies have the power to clean up the site and charge money from the site owners.\n\nThe BBMP has decided to charge from Rs 1.10 to Rs 3.5 per square metre to clean up the site in the event of site owner refusing to clean the site. If the site is uneven  BBMP would landfill it and would charge up to Rs 68 per cubic metre of soil.\n\nPalike has decided to levy cleanliness charge while collecting property tax. In case if the owner refuses to pay  Palike would file a case in the court and make the site owners pay the charge with penalty. The Health Department has been asked to take care of the cleanliness in their respective area and take up cleaning vacant sites.\n\nSo I hereby request u to kindly instruct the concerned person of BBMP to get the site cleaned at the earliest as monsoon season has already started. Hoping for an early action from ur side. Inspite of me lodging the complaint several times to BBMP control room & Health department so far no action has been taken from them.

Please take forward this suggestion further and kindly do the needful at the earliest. As per notice issued on October 11th  http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/arakere-lake-to-be-developed-at-a-cost-of-rs-14-crore/article5222326.ece?ref=relatedNews The development of Arakere lake would be taken up after rains subside. A direction in this regard has been issued to officials of BBMP and BDA by Transport Minister and city in-charge Ramalinga Reddy. Two-phased process Mr. Reddy visited the lake and the areas that were flooded on Thursday morning. He said lake development would be taken up in two phases at a cost of Rs. 14 crore. The tender for the first phase of development had already been floated twice by the BDA. But the work order could not be given as there were only single responses to the tenders  he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tender has been floated for the third time and the work order will be issued soon Ã¢â‚¬Â he added. He also inspected the 1.5-km stretch of the storm water drain that is being constructed there. He directed the BBMP officials to complete the work as soonas possible. It was complaints galore when Mr. Reddy met with the aggrieved citizens whose homes were flooded.

The service road below flyover which is the road from harlur connecting to ORR  towards eco space is made one way few months ago. There was frequent traffic jam in this junction earlier. Now the entire traffic towards ecospace side is taking the main road which is causing heavy traffic at the end of fly over and at Intel in main road.\n\nThe suggestion is to make this service road one way from eco space side; just reverse of current oneway road. The traffic moving towards Ecospace and Intel from Bangalore side should take this road. The traffic from ecospace & Intel from Marathahalli side should take the main road (ORR).\n\nThis would make service road traffic moving in opposite direction to ORR.

"Hello - The stretch from State Bank of Mysore  Marathalli Branch junction to Kundalahalli Gate signal has some useless \""No Parking\"" rules.

Autos are parked where buses are supposed to stop  thereby forcing the buses to stop in the middle of the road  thereby causing huge traffic pile through the day.\n2. There are several cars  cabs (white and yellow board)  min-vans parked exactly below/next to \""No Parking\"" sign boards on both sides of the road  thereby leading to huge traffic pile.\n\nIf the intention is to let these vehicles park at their will  then why do you even want to have \""No Parking\"" boards there.

Hello - I travel everyday through the Madiwala lake Road and have been several observations over the years. The below two observations are glaring  risky and in my view basic.\n\n1. The stretch from the beginning of Madiwala lake right up to the Axa Technologies signal (both sides of the road)  there are several speed brakers. None of the speed breakers have either white paint or reflectors or a sign board to suggest that there are speed breakers. Last week  in front of my eyes an elderly couple almost crashed into the footpath as the speed reader wasn\'t seen. This needs to be addressed immediately.\n\n2. On the same stretch  on both sides of the road  there are multiple left/right and U turns. This needs to be reviewed  as the primary cause for traffic pile on this stretch are the unnecessary turns (left/right/U). Unwanted turns to be stopped so that the traffic will keep moving slowly.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRegards \nBala.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

A divider should be built to divide the main road and service road near the flyover  so that KR Puram Traffic and Whitefield Traffic is dived to the Left and Right    This will solve unnecessary traffic build up and wastage of money.

The traffic on this road is so heavy that on few days like Thursday it is difficult to cross the road and the parking is allowed on the road for 4 and 2 wheeler vehicles.  The road is less than 30 feet wide and allowing parking has dwindled the space for vehicle movement. people park for taking food and visiting temple and this causes traffic pile up.

I am a resident of Channasandra  Bangalore. I am writing to report about the poor state of the Channasandra main road. This is an important road connecting main Bangalore to Chikka Tirupathi and is therefore is subject to heavy traffic daily. However  the state of the road is very poor with very large potholes that render large sections of the road un-drivable. This further leads to traffic congestion  especially during the morning rush  since all the cars  trucks try to avoid the potholes. Finally  since there is no divider over a major stretch of this road  many commuters (in an attempt to avoid the potholes) drive on the wrong side of the road - this can lead to future accidents.    The situation in the Channasandra main road had improved for a few days  in the beginning of 2014  but thereafter has declined and has worsened than ever before. The road condition is so bad that truck drivers and other motorists go way out into the opposite lane to avoid the potholes. It seems to me that an accident is imminent if something is not done soon.    28 Feb2015: Recently  some patch work has been done on this stretch of the road. I would first like to thank BBMP for providing this temporary relief  as driving on this road had become next to impossible. However  the way the repair work was done is very poor. Especially  close to  Hope Farm signal  the potholes reappeared one day after the repair work was completed. This is very disappointing  as we waited for such a long time for some action to be taken but were disappointed again.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages

Nagavarapalya main road is a very narrow stretch  with lots of traffic for people commuting to/from Bagmane tech park  DRDO  Kaggadasapura  and the nearby apartments/shops. Traffic jams have become very common here  especially at the Nagavarapalya main road/Big Bazaar road junction. To compound to the trouble here  the pavements here are not complete or are occupied by vendors/hawkers because of which pedestrians are compelled to use the road to walk upon. This creates further shortage of space for the traffic plying there. The only solution to all of these issues would be the widening of Nagavarapalya main road  which was proposed long back by the BDA.

Dear Sir/Mam     I have been staying in Marathahalli Chowdeshwari Layout Tulsi Theatre Road for past 5 years and still haven't seen anything close to something which can be called a Road or Footpath in the Tulsi Theatre Road.    It is a very busy road  given that it is the only exit path from the whole Chowdeshwari Layout to the main Road and hence sees tremendous number of commuters throughout day and night. This area falls very well within the Bangalore urban areas with huge professional crowd paying all kind of govt. taxes and also heavily contributing to local economy.    Still there is no proper road  just a broken mud pathway on which both motor vehicles and foot-walkers struggle to find their way everyday. If this was a village  it could be forgiven as crowd is less in villages. But with present conditions  the Tulsi-Theatre Road is a living hell for professionals and their families.     Some maintenance work normally destroys a road for some time  but in this case  there is persistent neglect on part of BBMP or some other corrupt commercial force is at work  at this neglect is happening for a long duration of 5-8 years.    I urge authorities to inspect the current conditions of the Tulsi Theatre Road at Marathahalli  its importance for residents and the needs to be addressed.

Post that all heavy vehicles are allowed by traffic cops themselves in the service road. The service road has 3 apartments and kids cross the service road every day to take their school buses. This is becoming a huge safety concern. When we informed the traffic cop in the junction  he sarcastically commented that we need to raise a complaint with the Siddaramaiah (Chief Minister).

It is very dangerous to join main road and many accidents have already occurred because of the illegally parked vehicles.

Traffic at marathalli can be managed better. Specially coming from KR Puram towards Bellandur. There is sufficient infrastructure for smoother commute through this junction. Only issue is with the management of traffic. There are 2 major amendments that can resolve this issue.   1. Bus stop is right after the merging traffic from ITPL and it takes more than a lane leaving only 1.5 lane for other traffic causing hiccups in the regular traffic. It needs to be moved further and the road to be divided for bus stop  2. U turn is right after the merging traffic from ITPL. It makes a criss cross between people coming from ITPL to take U turn and the ongoing ORR traffic. It should be moved further so that there is enough distance for people coming from ITPL to align to right lane and take U turn and also where there is more space for buses to take turn.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

There are very few buses to DLF new town viz. BC-4A (originating from jayanagar 4th block)  369N (from market) & 364F (from majestic).

The auto rickshaws charge a minimum of Rs.70 to reach DLF new town from BPL stop.\n\nMy suggestion for BMTC is to ply mini feeder buses from bannerghatta road to DLF new town  also connecting vijaya bank colony & devarachikkanahalli at a frequency of atleast 15 mins from 7AM to 10PM.\n\nI want to know what happened to the 300 mini buses procured by BMTC in the year 2013 for feeder services.\n\nIt is quite useless to run direct buses from majestic & market since they get stuck up in traffic  adversely affecting their schedule. There are already plenty of buses running on bannerghatta main road from majestic & market for every 3 mins.

On the corner of 2nd Cross  Charles Campbell Road  garbage is being dumped making the road unfit for walking .  Although attempts are being made at clearing this  it is not done regularly nor completely leaving the stretch unsightly and inviting mosquito and rat breeding areas.   Why can't the door to door garbage collection be enforced more rigidly with fines being imposed upon those residents who continue to protect and keep their personal spaces clean  thereby dumping their garbage on public roads and pavements without the slightest hesitation or thought about keeping public areas clean.  It is evident that unsanitary environment has been taking its toll on the residents of this area with almost one individual in every home falling ill of late.   I urge you to penalize those irresponsible individuals who do not wish to conform with the correct garbage disposal methods and put an end to every road corner or pavement being dumped with garbage.  To add to our woes  the cows attached to  Pankaj Dairy Farm are allowed to stroll freely in the area  and  feed on this garbage.

On Monday this week  I saw something which I haven't seen in a long  long while on Bangalore's roads - courtesy and concern for pedestrians / fellow human beings.  At 9 am  on Ganapathi Temple Road in Koramangala  a motorbike rider who was slightly ahead of me in the left lane  put out his right arm and signaled me to stop. I was surprised and confused (as the road was fairly empty  and no bike rider signals any more in Bangalore!)  but I stopped.  The pillion rider jumped off his seat  walked across to a young blind girl  waiting to cross the road. He held her hand  escorted her across the road  got back on to the bike and rode away.  Once a city known as Pensioner's paradise has degenerated into one in which old people fear for their safety on the streets and often freeze mid-way while crossing  confused by the chaotic traffic.  I hope readers feel inspired to show civic sense on the roads  encourage others to do the same and also teach their children these values.,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Non attendant of Nuisance Detector

Dear Sir \n\nGood Morning  I am writing this email with lots of hope and belief and looking for help and support from your side.\n\nI am Ankit Saxena from Kolkata (West Bengal). I am 25 years Old. I was the resident of Mahadevpura (Bangalore) for Six month in one Rented room at Maheshwari Nagar.\n\nI have a concern with my Owner Mr. Rama Swamy (from Tamil Naidu) with respect to my Security Deposit of 30 K.\n\nThe matter is  I have taken the rented room on 5th September 2015 at Maheshwari Nagar and agreed to pay the monthly rent of 5K and Security deposit of 30 K(Two Instalment).\n\nFirst month  I have paid 25K in which 5K was the room rent and 20K was the security deposit. Second month  I have paid 15k in which 5K was the room rent and 10K was the security deposit.\n\nTotal paid for two month is 40K in which 30 K was the security deposit and 10 K was the room rent.\n\nI have asked for the rental agreement but my owner has denied to give by saying  \'You people are searching job  so you have to change the room frequently\'. On being asked for any written proof he told us to trust on him and he will refund us the 25K after deduction of one month of paint charges i.e 5k from security deposit at any time on vacating with one month prior intimation. We trusted but he has cheated us.\n\nSir  We had done all the necessary part from our side but instead of paying 25 K  he just gave me 20 K and told us to move. I have asked several times for the remaining 5K but he ignored my words. On request of several times and after spending complete one night in front of his house like beggar  he has given me another 1 K and asked me to move. I have asked for remaining 4K but he started scolding by saying  \'Hindi People  If you have so much problem then go to your native\'  \'Do whatever you want  I have contact with MLA and my son will take care of it\'. He started saying lie that  I have asked you to inform 3 months before.\n\nOn enquiring the surrounding people  they have told it is not the first time  earlier also he has done like this. There are several instances happened earlier as well.\n\nThe resident of Mahadevpura are not so rich and belongs to middle class background.They are earning some money by putting lots of effort but people like \'Rama Swamy\' taking it very easily by misusing his power and in the name of MLA power.\n\nI am earning just 10 K and the small amount of 4 K matters for me alot. I have given whatever he asked but now he is not following for his words. I don\'t have rental agreement but my words are true. I am not the only victim but the other people also has the same problem. This is not my alone concern  other has the same concern.\n\nKindly sort the matter and protect many like me  who is facing the same problem but couldn\'t raise his voice.\n\nAddress: Door No. 48 Shree Manjunatha Nivas  Maheshwari Nagar 1st main Mahadevpura Post Bangalore â€“ 560048.\n\nPlease reply to this email or can contact me over call.\n\nThanking you...\n\nRegards \nAnkit Saxena\n+91-7204924632,"Removal of silt from nalla across culverts, etc.",Drainage chokes and blockages,Odour  foul smell  from drains

I am MANVACHAR S V. I am a senior citizen and own a property in Subbaiahnapalya. I have been troubled by land grabbers. Though I won case in High Court  they don\'t give respect to the court order. They warn me to kill me and my family. Banaswadi police also support these goons by taking bribe. Whenever I start to build  these people bring police and stop construction work. I have been facing these for past 30 years. These goons also don\'t let any development work of area. The land grabbers name is Srinivas and Gowramma. They are rich. I have only this property and no source of income. I have lost my health and money fighting these people. So I request you to provide support and help.

The cross road at Vinayaka Layout Bhoopasandra between 5th Cross & 2nd Main is a death trap especially during morning hours & dark too at night as no street lights are working here. School vehicles speed through 2nd Main crossing 5th Cross blindly in a hurry & there are on an average 1-2 collisions every week. Here  5th Cross is the major road whereas 2nd Main is minor. Request the authorities to install a speed breaker on either side of 2nd Main at the earliest & not wait for action until a life is lost or disabled forever. And have the street lights repaired.\nLike abroad  there should be a speed breaker on either side of every minor road in residential areas as children cycle & play around in these empty roads & can fall prey for speeding vehicles. I understand a playground fir kuds in every area is too much to ask for but a speed breaker is reasonable demand for safety....

Dear People     Just see attached map where I have tried to cover majority roads of the Whitefield area and those are regularly used by the people for daily commute to the office. In fact   entire Whitefield area (around 40 sq kms) road conditions are horribly bad and there are no actions being taken by Govt/BBMP.    I request everybody to support the post  raise the noise  provide ideas on how to solve the Whitefield (IT Hub) infrastructure issue.     Dear BBMP     Please notice the route map highlighted in the attached map. Here are the route points which are worst in condition from last 3 years and I am sure people will add more.    1. Road connecting ORR and WhiteField main road - from Mahadevapura ORR signal to HP company.  2. Terrific worst condition of the road Road starting from KRPuram Railway station to Hoodi to ITPL to HopeFarm signal.  3. HopeFarm signal is most worst and badly hit.  4. HopeFarm to Varthur lake to Kundanhalli gate.  5. Kundahalli gate to Graphite India signal to Hoodi again.    Few suggestions from my side. Any ideas/suggestions are welcomed.     1. All the signals' corners need to be having smooth curve so traffic can take easy turn and move fast. This is most easy and quick solution. Currently roads connecting to all the signals are at right angle (90 degree).  2. Just widen the road  there are unnecessarily and unusable footpaths lying on Whitefield main road. Clean up  make proper footpath  widen the road.  3. Construct proper road  no patches please. Just observe the traffic situation on the road.,Drainage chokes and blockages,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Private Land   Building   Society   Factories

From the past two three months sewage water is being released into the storm water drain due to which the storm water drain is full of stinking sewage water and thousands of mosquitoes are breeding on this permanent flow of sewage water. The storm water and sewage water from the areas around our residence from near the BBMP park near our house flows in a gush as this water overflow from near the park inundating the road and enter our house and drinking water sump. This has happened 3 times during the last one month.    I wish to enumerate the reasons for the flooding below.  1. The storm water drain which is 50 feet to the right of our residence was raised by nearly 3 feet at the junction connecting 4th main road with 18th cross. The top of this drain is two feet higher than road level of our residence.  2. The storm water drain which is opposite side our residence was raised all through the road till the BBMP park to the same height as the drain at the junction connecting 4th main road with 18th cross.   3. Due to which the water cannot flow to the storm water drain connection to the main road and water is always standing the storm water drain on 4th Main road drain.  4. The storm water drain at the other end of our road has been filled with mud and is permanently blocked. This has been pointed out to BBMP officials many times.  5. The storm water drain water which is sewage water form the surrounding areas from near the park is spilling on to the road and flows towards our house.  6. From the past few months sewage water is being released in the storm water drain in spite of complaints to the control room.   At the junction of 4 th main and 18 th cross road there is always a flooding of sewage water and rain water at the lightest drizzle.   2 calls to BBMP Bommanhalli Complaint number - 9898 on 04-09-2015 and    9943 on 27-08-2015.

Dear Team  there is no one comes to my street to pick up the garbage and one day I observed that the vehicle standing opposite to my street and when I asked him why are you not coming to my street to pick it  the driver said sir there is no budget allocated to pick the garbage from your street (my street has only 7-10individual building) and I tried talking to them very sweetly  politely and finally I agreed to pay them for tea/coffe  still the person did not come to the street. To my surprise these guys came on 1st June\'16 to pick the garbage to my street  I asked the same person how come you are here  he said sir contract change aagede so we are coming and we will coming daily and the guy took money from me for tea/coffee. Next day I was waiting and it was a super surprise that no one came to pick the garbage till date. usually people put the garbage on the road adjacent to my street but now people started shouting at everyone and today early morg I got blusting from a lady till now I am not able to digest and forget the face of that lady who was talking so rudely to me for just putting dominos pizza box on the road side where there is huge dump of garbage. its my bad luck. well along with garbage we have a drainage problem  were every alternate days some one from BBMP comes to that spot  he digs and then goes away leaving the hole open and after a week or 10 days again the team comes closes the potholes and again they dig it after 2 days. This is going on from past 4 months and it is very difficult to cross this road and go. one day I was about to fall on this hole due to dirty  stickily road.

They do that for food  they do not understand they are hurting me. A few of my neighbors fed them too  and the dogs chase them away and growl at them.  I did not report this to any authority because i am afraid they will be horded with hundreds of other dogs and may engage in dog fights( they are a little territorial) .

I recently moved to Bangalore from Delhi and the roads were the major shocker for me. Moving to Kaggadasapura was only for a reason that it is close to my work place. But the horror of non-maintenance of roads kills me every morning while leaving for work as the traffic gets clogged anywhere without prior notice. The moment I started to sink in the fact that not only the roads are narrow and not well maintained  another major issue popped up - POTHOLES. They dig up the road which is already non-existent and leave it unrepaired. This is causing lot of road rage as everyone is getting late.

A very large number of cars are illegally parked/stopped right underneath No parking/stopping signals along the stretch of Sampige Road Malleswaram between 8th and 11th cross. As it is  Sampige road is very narrow  with very high traffic density  bus stops and large extent of pedestrian usage. These illegally parked cars along the left side of the road  cause awful traffic bottlenecks everyday. Usually there are traffic policemen in the vicinity  but it never seems to have an effect. A few months ago  barricades were setup to prevent the illegal parking  however the problem wasn\'t solved simply because the barricades themselves became a nuisance to traffic. I have raised this concern several times on the  Bangalore traffic Police page on Facebook  and nothing has been done. Authorities  please rid Sampige Road of this illegal parking/stopping menace and let the traffic flow smoothly.

Most of the train over-bridges in Bangalore city are NOT covered with concrete. Usually they are covered by metallic sheets which is of no use (as they are/will cracked or broken).  Whenever a train passes on a train over-bridge  the public whoever is under the bridge IS SUFFERING as he/she will be drenched with urinals and stools falling from the train\'s toilets directly on the public. Public has no choice other than waiting till the train passes the bridge  especially people on 2 wheeler and pedestrians. Places like Oklipuram (near mejestic) has frequent trains passing and also are very crowded. Whenever there is a train moving on the bridge  people on 2 wheelers usually wait on either sides till the train passes  which also leads to traffic jams and accidents during peak traffic hours.

The lift in my building in which I rent a house has not been working since March. In mid April  I had a ligament injury on my ankle. And because the lift is not working  I have to climb up and down 3 floors daily. Because of this  my foot is not healing. When I asked the in charge about the situation  he said that because the lift is 10 years old  hence its spare parts are not easily available. If at all they do get it  it will cost 1 lakh rupees. If not  they\'ll have to replace the lift which will cost 5 lakh rupees. The problem is that none of the owners are ready to shell out the money  hence lift is still not repaired. This is causing me and other residents a lot of problems.,Minor repairs to municipal property,Sweeping of road,Street lighting

I would like to request you to look into it.\n\nHerein  if necessary  requirement of taking more crowd can be understood. But  uselessly stuffing people in buses is not.

I also observed areas on the lake where the fence has been broken and barb wire tied in its place  which wasn't the case yesterday.

Seegehalli Village near Kadugodi on SH35 has no street lights. It is a poor cousin of Whitefield which in turn is the most neglected area of Bangalore. There are around 30 plus apartment complexes including some very prestigious and densely polluted ones. However the main road surprisingly has no street lights. This results in several accidents while residents have to depend on secondary sources of light like the light from the vehicular movement and the residual lights of the apartments and shops on the SH-35. I have no idea as to which agency to be approached for the same. It could be BDA or PWD or some other agency. Seegehalli village Panchayat is one of the richest village panchayats in the country and charges a huge sum as property tax; but the residents have to suffer for basic amenities like street lights. Recently a surge in the crime is also a direct result of no street lights as anti social elements make merry in the dark. Incidents of chain snatching  car/bike jacking etc. have increased and it is really unsafe to walk alone in the nights especially for the ladies and kids. Kindly look into the issue and help us resolve the issue.,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property,Bad patches potholes on roads
I have got information that all outstation buses which used to pass through Jalahalli Cross have been barred from plying through this junction. They will have to take the flyover and all passengers will have to board the buses at either Yeshwantpur or Parle factory toll plaza.     What is the objective of selectively banning the private vehicles  when state local and outstation as well as private local buses operate at will? This ban came into effect when the unruly crowd set fire to the local buses during the recent events at Jalahalli. What is the logic?    What are the people who reside in between these two points supposed to do? It is almost impossible to get an auto or bus from HMT factory road near ISRO or HMT school ground. How are we supposed to reach the boarding point at around 8.30 or 9pm  when there is no mode of transport at these hours?

"I am one of the 1000+ residents of Prasanth Layout  adjacent to Hope Farm. Since 2 weeks I spend 20 minutes more everyday to get to Marthahalli. All thanks to ""Bangalore Traffic Police"". From Prasanth Extension we could earlier bypass Hope Farm. One day suddenly i find the bypass divider has been blocked. I would have been really happy to pay a small toll fee to keep the divider open. I have lived here for pas t 5 years and never seen the dividers cause any confusion or jams EVER. I still do not understand the grand design of Bangalore traffic.     Earlier the road dividers helped:  1. Reduce load on hope farm.   2. Worked as a bypass to hope farm.  3. Saved time for 1000+ residents and many other who took this road.  4. This is nearly 400 meters from Hope Farm so it never caused any jams for people heading towards Hope Farm.    Now with the dividers blocked since 2 weeks :  1. Heavy load on hope farm.   2. No bypass to hope farm.   3. 1000+ residents now added to traffic jam at hope farm.  4. Road to Hope Farm and Road to ITPL is getting blocked. Traffic from Prasanth extension trying to get to whitefield have to get to hope farm. There is a fight going on to get to this main road as traffic from ITPL to Hope Farm is unforgiving to allow anybody to enter ahead of them. I have spend sometimes 15 minutes or more to get into line.     I have drawn a small map with the problem statement. Hopefully this helps our traffic police to rethink.    Please do not make the traffic problem worse than it is. I hope Bangalore Traffic Police heed this humble request and reopen these barriers soon or provide a better alternative soon.

Dear sir \nI am staying in Milk colony Malleshwaram west. It is in between srirampuram and Yeshwantpur.  There is route no.52/52e playing in this route (Yeshwantpur to Raghavendra colony). All the buses (except one) which are playing in this route are very old buses so that every week repair will come. During this time  no body is bothered to send the alternate buses for that timings.  In the peak hours also   these buses will not follow timings  sometimes after 6.00 pm we have to wait for 1 hr or one and half hour in market/townhall to catch this bus .  \nSo i humbly request your goodself to increase the buses in this route atleast in moring 8.30 to 9.30 am and 6.00 to 7.00 pm peak hours.\nApart from this  if rain comes all the window seat passengers have to get up because of the absence of window glasses or leakages in the buses.\n\nThanks\n\nGIRISH.R\npadoorgiri gmail.com,Minor repairs to municipal property,Drainage chokes and blockages,Person falling in Manhole
Hi  I am from Subramanyanagar (Rajajinagar II Stage) resident and its very hard to find the BMTC buses plying on the route. We have only 82 Bus plying from Majestic to Yeshwanthpur via Subramanyanagar. In our ward both Subramanyanagar & Gayatrinagar  we have very limited buses and that too only for Majestic area. I agree the main road is a smaller one for the buses to commute  but we do not have any option.

The railway underpass near Yelahanka police station always gets filled up with rain water whenever there is a downpour and because of which there is huge traffic jams that happen. On 13th April 2015 because of un-seasonal rains the underpass got filled up with rain water which threw the traffic out of gear. It took more than 2 hours to get home.

Davis road had been dug up few months back  following which road got rocky and thereby narrowed. The roads around the tannery road circle- all are pothole ridden and contribute to the enormous traffic jam over there. The Benson town main road is always home to potholes irrespective of the rains. This being followed by nandidurga road  the stretch between Benson town main road and the road that stretches to jayamahal- this stretch of the nandidurga road is an extremely dangerous accidental area. No matter how many ever times they patch up the road  this stretch is dug up perennially  causing a perennial outbreak of potholes- deep ones. Last but not the least  jayamahal road next to fun world and mainly the tv tower junction has been the most accident prone area causing a lot of accidents due to the poor patch up work of the potholes and bad maintenance of the road.

I am a resident of 6th Cross  Manjunatha Nagar  Raghuvanahalli  Kanakapura Road. The locality is full of independent houses. The BBMP does not come and clear the garbage in this area. Hence  the residents are forced to dispose of garbage in plastic bags in all the vacant plots in and around this locality. Residents also through garbage in the open drainage. If this continues  then when the monsoon comes we will have Chennai floods like situation in this locality. There is no storm water drainage here and most of the drainage are clogged with plastic bags filled with garbage.  Many drainages have over grown bushes. There is absolutely no way for water to go when it rains and I am sure all the independent houses will be inundated with rain water if this situation continues. \n\nMy sincere request to the concerned authorities to clear the drainage of garbage and also of the vacant plots in around this area.\n\nThank you,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage lorry not reported for service

It is not just the responsibility of the Government but citizens as well to come forward & contribute to their capacity towards the welfare of their areas but someone has to take the lead.The indivisuals must contribute the labour of their mind and body.Constituency M.Ps & M.L.As have done something but sufficient has to be done.It is the trumph of co-operative work.A large sum declared for the overall development  must be seperated for the old heritage city & a special team consisting of Trade associations Resident associations Elected Representatives & other government officials must initiate make over plan for the Central Business District.What we need is perfect co-ordination between different Government agencies like BBMP BWSSB BESCOM TRAFFIC & LAW ORDER POLICE DEPARTMENT TELECOM DEPARTMENT * ABIDE ETC.The condition in patches are so worst that even people or traders visiting the old city say that they have a better civic amenties available in their respected places.Facts means nothing unless they are rightly understood rightly related & rightly interpreted.\n\nWe need to act & that too speedy action is the need of the hour.Forget the past and let the experts come forward & with the help of reputed urban planners do something for our city.What we can do or get it done by the Government or Private sources are mentioned below..\n\n*Constructions of more public or pay and use toilets.\n\n*Construction of multi stori parking complexes.\n\n* Restrict shops from display of their products outside their premises.\n\n*New constructions/renovations should have ample parking spaces & rain water harvesting system.\n\n*Proper maintainance of city market & available parking lots.\n\n*Mini buses to be allowed in the city limits.\n\n*Ban bullock carts & other slow moving transport mediums.\n\n*Shift the transport companies to other spacious places.\n\n*New scientific solutions to overflowing drains specially during the rains.\n\n*Restriced parking in the congested lanes.\n\n*Better co-ordination between the different Government agencies.\n\n*Proper street lights to be installed.\n\n*50 years old drainage systems to be changed.\n\n*Prepaid auto counters to be set up.\n\n*A mini garden to be developed in the area.\n\n*Involve Resident and Trade Associations for speedy action & suggestions\n\n*Metro stations are bound to come hence better usage of  the land acquired .\n\nRebuilding the old city does not seem to happen but at least short term or medium term measures will ensure the free flow of traffic movement & hastle free trade.Metro Rail is also coming in the city but clear picture has to emerge.The plan is not with the public.Already a debate is going on pertaining to Metro Rail mess threatening High court & Vidhan Soudha etc..We like the dreams of future better than the history of the past..Wish Metro a good luck.\n\nShortage of basic amenties have resulted in the NRI\'s and Brand conscious people not visiting the old heritage city for business but with the active participation of the government and the citizens a complete make over will help a lot.It will motivate the morals of the traders & they\nwill have a last laugh and will be contributing more generously and happily to the exchequer as they will be having perfect environment to live and trade..There are no barriers that cannot be bridged except the ones men create in their own minds.The Government is the best judge of the requirements of the citizens hence it shall do the needful..\n\nThanks..\n\nThanks a lot..\n\nRegards..\n\nSajjan Raj Mehta..\n\nEx President.Jain Yuva Sangathan Bangalore\n\nEX.

"Many drivers jump the red-traffic lights at this traffic signal on Old Madras Road  and Varthur Road (Big Bazaar junction). Pedestrians  drivers coming from Varthur road (which is smaller)  even with with right of way/green signal need to be extremely vigilant  due to this unsafe  dangerous vehicle driving behaviour of certain dis-courteous  unconsiderate drivers. \n\nI only recently noticed that a surveillance camera has been installed at this junction. My assumption is that this camera is operational and is used for traffic surveillance. I do not believe most commuters who cross this junction are aware that there is a surveillance camera installed here. \n\nRequest authorities to prominently put \""CCTV installed at Junction\"" signs  especially about 150 m  on either side of the junction on Old Madras Road. This could even be displayed at Byappanahalli police station which is right at this junction.\n\nSeeing these surveillance signs  it is hoped that drivers will practice safer and more disciplined driving behaviour.\n\nThank you!",Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

As I travel through that stretch every day  I cant even breath well till I cross the stretch and another 500 mts beyond the lake. I\'m not sure how the authorities are allowing such burning of plastic waste to happen. I\'m sure they cant say they didn\'t observe as there is a dense smoke most of the times.

"BACKGROUND/SITUATION:\nThe toilets in the metro stations seem to be tucked away  and for some reason  not advertised through the conventional symbols.\nAnyway  for those wanting to use the toilets  the service is available: One needs to pay customer service INR 3.00  get a receipt  ask for directions  and  walk over to the toilet (correctly so outside of the metro platform area).\n\nThe one at Swami Vivekananda Metro seems to be at floor level. The toilet at Byappanahalli Metro Station has the floor level raised many inches  above the ground level. The toilet at Indiranagar has the same issue of being raised (these pictures could be from M.G.Road instead. However  I am pretty sure it is from Indiranagar).\n\nWhen you look at the pictures  on can see that the physically handicapped (wheel-chair bound symbol) is there in the toilet. However  can a wheel-chair confined person be able to independently go through the double doors  access and use the toilet? A wheel chair confined person  will need to go up to the level of the toilet  and will also need to rotate/navigate their wheel-chair inside. (Inside pictures not attached. However  my guess is it will be extremely difficult for such a person to independently use the toilet facilities). \n\nA google image search for  \n\n\""handicap toilet dimensions\""\n\""handicap toilet plan\""\n\nwill provide more information more what toilet facilities for physically challenged person looks like. I have attached sample images  dimensions I found (for some reason does not display. However  google image will show).\n\nSome questions:\n1. Do all the exisiting  in operation  Metro stations have such toilets for the physically challenged? \n2. Do the new Metro stations coming up have such toilets for the physically challenged? \n\nACTION NEEDED: \n1. If the answer to the first question is \""No\""  I request such a facility be provided. \n2. If the answer to the second question is \""No\""  I request such facilities be factored in and provided.\nIn my opinion  one unisex  but well-designed for a physically-challenged person needs  well-equipped (grab bars etc.)  easy access toilet should be enough.\n\nBENEFIT:\n Using toilet facilities with independence  privacy  dignity  safety and comfort  and subsequently inclusion in using the Metro system  by our physically challenged friends.\n\nThank you!",Fogging,Mosquito nuisance,Garbage not lifted from house gully

Hello Sir/Madam \n\nThis complaint is with respect to pathetic road conditions in Ejipura.\nEspecially on Sri Ram Temple Road  Ejipura.\n\nThis main road has been digged out from one end for fixing the pipelines a month back. But after fixing the pipelines beneath the road  the construction of the same road has not happened. \nNow this road is full of mud and every where the bits of garbage and rainy water is getting stored in the potholes  thanks to the pathetic road condition.\nAlthough the pipeline work had happened last year.\nBut the road was not constructed completely. Only cements were put at pothole places. Due to the damaged road  even garbage collecting machine is also not coming inside to pick the waste and thus the locality is becoming Unhygienic and unclean. \nEven to commute on a two wheeler is not possible. \nAll the means of transport eg: Autos  Cab drivers etc. do not want to take this route  and are asking the people to get down at the point very far away.\nSo travelling and approachability of means of transport is very difficult now.\n\nRequest you to please adhere to this complaint at the earliest and prepare the good road.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

Numerous efforts are taken by the Bengaluru Civic body and the Traffic Department of Bengaluru police to make OUR city  a pleasant place to live in. However  the indiscriminate growth of private transport is making all these efforts go waste  with ever increasing pollution and traffic congestion in the City. Roads and bylanes are chocked with parking cars on either side of the road and both sides of payments (if they exist).\nOne way to get rid of this malady is by putting no parking signs at frequent intervals of the roads / lanes  and defaulters penalized without any leniency.\nAlternatively  all roads are converted into \'pay and park\' roads  so that people who park their vehicles on the public roads are made to pay hefty charges. If this is scrupulously imposed  most people will desist from illegal use of public roads.\nOf course  all these efforts require \'honest policemen\' imposing the rules without greed to make money for personal gains.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Private Land   Building   Society   Factories,Drainage chokes and blockages

Traffic comes to a sudden halt due to someone stopping to purchase from the carts and they stop in the middle of the road  blocking traffic. This has led to several accidents and rear ending incidents. Vendor carts  trucks and autos are parked on the Ring Road on both sides at almost any time of the day. I see them unloading from big trucks to smaller goods vans causing traffic bottlenecks. Police are very visible trapping hapless motorists for speeding. They are not concerned with these parked vehicles going about their business. In fact instead of enforcing slow moving traffic like overloaded trucks and autos to go on the Left lane  they are busy collecting revenue. This extreme danger to the motorists on the Ring road has to be brought to notice of the traffic police who need to take action to prevent such vendors and trucks from blocking the lanes. They could patrol the Ring road for a few days and request the vendors to move to the service road on the side of the ring road. Traffic has increased a lot from the Nagarbhavi junction up to Tumkur road and push cart vendors  jaywalkers and stray cattle are a major danger to both the motorists and the public. I request the BTP to take action to move these vendors to the side streets and free up the ring road.,Unauthorised construction development,Municipal Plot,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Dear Sir \nI wish to draw your attention towards the poor maintenance of roads and drainage in our locality. We are living in the WARD NO: 54  New Sai Colony Ext  BELATHUR  KADUGODI with 50+ families from past 5+ years.\nThe roads in our locality have not been repaired for a long time. There are pits and ditches on the roads everywhere. The condition of the road becomes all the worst during the rainy season. They cause road accident. At night people sometimes stumble down. Moreover  these pits provide breeding ground for the mosquitoes. Thus there is an outbreak of mosquitoes in the locality leading to the spread of malaria.\nEven the sanitation is very bad here. The roads here are not swept regularly. They are dirty with full of rubbish. The drainage water flows all over the street  especially during the rainy days. There are many pits on the road. They are filled with drainage water. Foul smell arises from it and it is a place for mosquitoes to breed. The children are often affected by these.\nWe  therefore  request you to kindly take necessary action to mend the ways so that people of the area have good roads and drainage system.\nSincerely \nGopal B\nWard No:-54 \nSai Colony Extn  Belathur \nBangalore-67.\nMob: - 9632544662,Repairs re-surfacing of roads footpaths,Drainage chokes and blockages,Bad patches potholes on roads

Thanks to innumerable cuts in the median dividers every 100 mts from Sindhoor Functional hall near 6th phase bus stop to Delmia Signal.

Just after the subway the pile up of traffic some 5th phase till exit of the subway towards JP Nagar 3rd phase this junction is hopelessness at its best  there are no traffic controllers more often than not . Somehow after fighting the way out in another 50 mts there is big line up of vehicle stopping after HP petrol bunk entering the 2nd phase (from 3rd phase  5th phase).

Hi Team I am resident of HSR layout and i have been living in this area from past 25 years. I have seen the HSR grow in leaps an bounds from past few yeas.. As the city grows  garbage disposal become an big issue. In HSR we are also facing the same issue. I stay near by HSR layout Police station (1st Sector 27th Main Road) and there a many shops near by. The waste which is generated by these shops are not segregated and thrown oustide most on the footpath or on the main Road. As a result its become a dump yard and the the BBMP people instead of cleaning up the mess they just burnt all the dump... This is pathetic....

( This is not a complaint but this is an innovative  towards changing my city or developing my city) please read through it.\n\nHello Bangaloreans \n\nI want to change my city\'s view with a new innovative idea  by putting forth with the ideas of my  and my friends.\n   As you all know that Bangalore traffic rules are mostly violated  as riders don\'t keep up the rules.\n    We think that when red light appears  it is kind of punishment to wait for longer time.\n    So  here we present our idea in which boring traffic signals can be enjoyed with the informative message.\n    Our idea is about a &quot;Digital Traffic T.V.&quot; where the idle time spent during the red signal can be used as informative as near the traffic signals if we set up a Digital T.V in which we can portrait about the awareness of traffic rules and information of rights of citizens  advertising or giving any important information etc etc and the topic  should be changed every month so that the viewers or the riders will not get bored of waiting for green signal.\n      Another thing is that as  we have plenty of solar energy  we can use solar panel for the connection of Digital T. V as how it is used  for Traffic Signal Lights where we can save electricity also.\n\nDon\'t you think this is an great idea?\n\nIf you think so please join hands together by forwarding our idea to as many as possible until it reaches the concerned authorities to get implemented.\n\nThank you every one for your patience to read the entire thing.\n\nIf you think this is an great idea please make sure that this reaches the concerned authorities. \n\nThank you once again ,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

"I live in an apartment in front of the newly opened \""Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Jogging Track\"". Every night aroung 10-15 stray dogs gather together and howl at their loudest. This creates a terrible menace. People can\'t sleep properly  the children cannot study and the elderly freak out. I believe these dogs feed on the dumping yard right next to the track and also on other open garbage spread all around the lake the track circumscribes. This problem can be fixed by bettering the infrastructure at the dumping yard  providing more number of closed garbage containers to the residential apartments and collecting the garbage daily without waiting for it to overflow. This will also help increased cleanliness and hygiene in the locality.",Garbage not lifted from house gully,Sweeping of road,Garbage lorry not reported for service

Yet again BBMP has failed to control the dog population which roams in packs and attacks children. my son was returning on his cycle this morning  from his tuitions from Brigade Millennium towards 24th Main  JP Nagar 5th phase  when he was viciously chased by a pack of 10-15 dogs. Trying to race ahead in a bid to escape  he fell and injured himself badly and came back home bleeding and crying  traumatised by the pack of dogs. This situation could have ended really badly. What is the BBMP waiting for? How many children need to be attacked and injured or God forbid  maimed and killed before it swings into action???,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

The lane from Bellandur Service road going inside towards Green Glen layout till HDFC bank and beyond is very narrow. Most of the times people park their cars on both sides of the roads  resulting in a traffic logjam most of the times and also making it difficult for school buses to ply. The lane from HDFC bank to Apollo doesn't even have space for parking on either side but people still part their cars blocking traffic.

I am a resident of ISRO Housing Colony next to HMT School in Jalahalli (HMT) area.    My complaint is regarding a road connecting the Tumkur Road (From Peenya Metro Station) to HMT area.   This road has very high traffic since the other road connecting Goragunte Palya to BEL circle is always busy  most of the vehicles use this road.  This road gets divided near the Railway Overbridge where there is a deviation to the left to go to ISRO Housing Colony  Tata Aquila  HMT Watch Factory etc  and the right side to got to HMT Main Factory  HMT Hospital  Prestige Apartments etc.   However  near the deviation the road is very bad going towards left since there is no tar on the road and only crushed stones are left.   Especially during nights it is a nightmare to drive on this road for two wheelers and can cause serious accidents.   Therefore  it is requested that this road may be repaired urgently along with sufficient lighting in the junction.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages,Bad Patches

I am sorry to report that the drainage system in our locality (9th cross  Kalappa layout  Basavanagar ) leaves much to be desired. The present drainage system is so defective that a good shower would create the whole area into a collection of small lakes and pools. The clogging of rain-water in some of these parts of the lanes becomes as deep as two feet. Consequently the whole traffic is dislocated and life comes to a grinding halt during rains. We won't be able to have our food at home when these drains open out. Drainage slabs are missing since ages..     Many a time this problem has been brought to the notice of the concerned authorities but nothing has been done. May we hope now that you would immediately look into this matter and take urgent steps to avoid such public nuisance!,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Odour  foul smell  from drains

The Road connecting Vidyaranyapura last bus stop to MS Palya - Yalahanka Road is closed now almost more than 6 months now. There was some road laying work happening  but that also stopped for 3 months now. Not sure what is the issue. \nNow there is a alternative road provided for BMTC  heavy vehicles through a residential layout almost parallel to earlier road. \nNow the issues are 2  \n1. It have too many turnings  many times Bus or lorry are struck in jams due to these 90 Deg turns. \n2. Electric wires hanging very close to road (whenever there is a crossing or heavy vehicles  there is a danger of touching these electric cables). \n3. Since this is little longer route and heavy vehicle movement through residential narrow roads  always Danger of accidents to people living there. \n4. Now Thindlu road also closed  so traffic increased on this road as to reach Sahakar nagar also we need to depend on this road only (through MS Palya  GKVK road)\n\nSo request 2 solutions. \n1. Parmanent  solution : Quickly lay the road  open for public which is closed for long time now. \n2. Quick / Alternative solution : Open up another road joining Last bus stop to GKVK road  which is only around 100 Mtrs away. Currently it is blocked for Bus / truck with a height barricade. I understand due to safety of residential it is done so  but anyway current route already going through residential layout  so this route is shortest and ease out some traffic and dangers at current road.

"Its not a ""complaint"" as such  it would be a suggestion to all the MLAs  MPs and other high level people who owns or are they have controls to  the public places like Temple.  Here we have an example of H.S.R Layout. On the name of religious festival  100s of Watt of electricity is just getting wasted just for decoration. Recent news shows that Bangalore is having trouble getting enough amount of electricity  and here in 19th Main Road  H.S.R layout  Sector 3   the Sai Temple we have Series of 40W bulbs or more used for lighting up the whole street and the ground which is in front of the Temple. And my assumption would be  there are more than 500 bulbs so the usage would be 500bulbsx40W=20kW and its a big number.  I am sure that treasury of the Sai Mandir temple would be having enough money to pay those hefty bills but it doesn't justify the usage.    In the era   where people are being told to move from ""CFLs"" to ""LED"" lights  we have 40W bulbs being used.    My honest suggestion to the government and the law makers to have some laws that should not allow such unwanted use of electricity.     P.S: I am not against the Temple or anyone in personal but  we as a responsible citizen of Bangalore   should have a sense of ""go green""ism in us.",Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain
Dear Concerned\n\nI am writing this note to bring everyoneâ€™s attention towards the bad condition of Roads in Simhadri Layout  Uttarahalli  Bangalore - 560061. No authorities are looking into the bad roads in the colony and itâ€™s been a nightmare to use these roads .Moreover  now in the Monsoon season  roads became worse and elderly people canâ€™t walk and none of the cab / auto will drop / pick up from resident. However  no one seems to pay any heed to the situation. End to the colony there are many houses and water logging will happen. The logged water is home for deadly viruses due to which people in this area are more prone to get sick because of water borne diseases. Through this medium  I would like to file a complaint against the competent authorities  who are not showing any interest in this area and the situation is getting bad to worst. Please look into this and advise. Thank you.\n\nRegards \nVishnu Kumar,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

I am deliberately continuing on the same complaint  because I believe that whatever fix up they did after the BWSSB work on SGR Dental college road was absolutely lousy job.   After so much of digging for the pipeline on this road  it was never leveled properly. One fine day (after months)  they just came and put some tar all over and called the work done. It did not last through even one season! 2-3 months that's it!   Who is the in-charge for this? Who approved this kind of work? Why are you wasting tax payers' money???   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Till last week there was major BWSSB work happening on this road.

The place where the garbage is being disposed connects the  hosur road and adugodi area. It just takes 10 min of walk and most of the people prefer taking that lane coz it is more convenient as there are colleges and also some MNC companies. along with that there is also a bus stop that connects market and hosur road. \nOn the other hand there is school running right beside the place where garbage is being disposed. It is a residential place and is a problem for the people walking through that way. \nTo add on  every morning there will a market kept to sell the vegetables and stuffs related. The waste of the same is getting disposed over there. \nThe pics of the same are being posted. I request and hope there will be some changes taken in that place at the earliest since summer is starting and it would affect the health of people. I also request to make some arrangements for the disposal of the garbage for the people who earn their daily earnings in the market and the same garbage has to be taken away everyday. \n\nThank you,Providing removing replacing dustbins,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Collection point not attended properly

It is despicable to note that this silicon city which should be a model one  is having this problem of garbage. Instead off dumping in no man\'s land they are dumping right in the midst of residential areas.

Hi     I am writing to ichangemycity as a last resort with respect to the no of issues faced because of - Manjushree Bar & Restaurant located on 15th main road  Basaweshwarnagar  near Water Tank Bus Stop.     Location: There are a couple of schools within 1-2 kms of this bar and restaurant for which students  teachers and parents of the neighbourhood have to use the same road of this bar to reach their destination and considering that this place is quite crowded even during the day and during and soon after school hours  it brings unwanted attention to the young kids and make them more curious about the place. Also  this road is a bridge road for bus stops  super markets hospitals for the neighbourhood and commuting across this stretch is always ugly.    Parking Issues: The customers for this bar & restaurant tend to use up all the neighbourhood house gates and sometimes dont park it even properly thereby making it a lot inconvenient specially for the residents of 15th  15th A main and 14th main road. Even residents have to park their cars elsewhere till late late or next morning at times since most of the customers tend to come out of the bar and remove the vehicles pretty late in the night.     Late night brawls: The customers of this bar seems to spend late nights on the road fighting and making nuisance till late 1-2 am in the night specially during weekends and long weekends. There seems to be no end to it offlate and there are several nights when we have spent sleepless with no options to overcome this issue.    I have lost hopes with the local police and not too sure how much of help they are in this matter as nothing has happened towards shifting this place for the past so many years. I hope this would be my last resort and complaint towards this matter and fully trust that ichangemycity will come to our rescue.

"I am the resident of shantinagar. It was the best area once upon a time. Its been more than a year that we have no road.  Some guys come over saying they are BBMP and digged the road   saying that they are replacing the old drainage system to new by taking a bribe of 5k INR for each house. (Saying ""We will do it properly if you give""). I wounder how many of them gave that 5000 INR to those guys!     Problem 1: They have completely forgotten about our road to clean the mess up. They left the muddy road by filling the digged area with mud. When it rains  this area is a nightmare to all the residents. Going home is biggest task  getting water clogged is terrible  drainage water coming inside  ground floor houses lying low lying area. We are facing this problem more than a year. Can't BBMP solve this issue? Is it big task for them?    Problem 2: All of sudden  somebody comes over and opens one of drainage and created a path for water to go and left it unattended. Further down the road in Basappa Road  we have another leakage. We could see the chunk of toilet sediments on the road as well as in our Sump.     Hygenic is out of question. How do we keep ourselves healthy?     It you still have doubt that this is just a hoax? Please come and visit this area and feel it  talk to residents about this issue.     Please take this complaint on serious note and fix this issue with priority as CRITICAL ISSUE.     PS: Attaching photos of Basappa Road taken from my mobile.

Many IT employees  students  call centre workers and others live in Munekolala in Marathalli which has poor roads causing a number of problems for the residents. This area has a number of PGs and thousands of men and women living in PG accomodation as well as flats. Many of the roads are full of potholes and cause a lot of inconvenience at time of rains. Commuting to offices from Munekolala is problematic because in many cases the office cabs do not even enter the area citing bad roads. This causes an additional safety issues specially at night for women employees.    We performed a survey of the roads in Munekolala area this week. We segregated roads into four according to their condition and %wise result is as below:    We could cover almost 90% of the Munekolala area.    Roughly 40% of roads are completely damaged  17% are just gravel/metal roads  13 % of roads half or more damaged.  Only 30% are good roads (many with potholes/diggings/repair works  but lesser in no)  Even though named Good Roads  they have potholes or diggings for pipe/electricity connections  but in a limited number.    Around half of the roads will be entirely unusable  even for walking after rains. Company cabs do not cover many of these areas because of road condition and they drop employees at a distant place which makes it dangerous especially during late nights.    We urge BBMP to fix the roads in Munekolala as soon as possible.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

I own a KTM RC390. It is an extremely powerful bike and also is pretty expensive. I wouldn\'t want to go into the details about the price of my bike but I would like to mention that I have paid 44 000 rupees as road tax to the government. This money that I have spent is to ride my bike freely on well tarred roads  which is not the case. The road right opposite CMRIT college was a well tarred road until there was some underground work that was done. The road has been dug down and not been tarred back and it is close to impossible to ride my bike on this road. This is just one of the examples. I personally feel that if I\'am  as a responsible citizen  paying 44 000 rupees as road tax  should be able to use my expensive bike on well tarred roads. The lack of good roads and horrible potholes will decrease the lifetime of my bike and repairs for the same will be an additional expense which I certainly do not think I\'am liable to pay. I would suggest that even if any sort of underground work or any electrical and plumbing work is done  that the roads be at least tarred back properly. It is a humble request.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

At the start of the bhoganahalli road from Panathur end  the road has a big pothole  filled with water/sewage and spread across the road.

We have a pedestrian underpass which connects Kempe Gowda BMTC Bus Stand  KSRTC Bus Stand and Bangalore City Railway Station. This underpass is the safety path for thousands of travelers.     Off late  we have observed that this underpass remain closed during the early morning hours (4 - 6 am or so) when lot of people arrive at the bus stands and railway stations. Due to this  travelers are forced to do jaywalking to reach the other side of the road.     The traffic police has erected barricades to stop jaywalking and the travelers are squeezing themselves through a small gap between barricades. This causes the following major issues:    1) Huge pileup of crowd on both ways of Gubbi Thotadappa Road causing traffic congestion  2) Increasing chances of accidents because of speedy vehicles hitting pedestrians crossing the road  3) Increasing chances of pick pocketing and  suitcase lifting    I request the concerned authorities to make the pedestrian underpass functional 24/7. They may have to employ couple of security personals for the safety of passengers.

I am a daily commuter of BMTC buses. Also  I have travelled in the public transport of major cities of India. I have 2 complaints for the BMTC to take note of.\n1) Speed of buses - The speed of almost all Non AC buses for some unknown reason is very slow. I work in ITPL and have to travel from Hebbal daily.  I understand there is traffic and the drivers have to be careful of other vehicles and the passengers safety. But the buses will literally crawl at sometimes and usually will be very slow. I have noticed this on many routes in Bangalore. We commute daily to office and to cover a distance of 20km  I need to get out of house almost 2 hours early. Counterparts bus drivers in cities like Pune  Mumbai  Delhi  Hyderabad are much faster than Bangalore buses in same amount of traffic or even more traffic. I request BMTC to take note of this issue and increase the average speed of buses in Bangalore.\n\n2) Attitude of bus conductors - The attitude of bus conductor here I observed is very bad. Firstly  they will talk as if they own the bus and are doing a favour on the passengers by allowing them in the bus. They will talk as if they are taking out all their frustration on the passengers. Secondly  these guys dont entertain passengers coming from other states. Instead of being co-operative and kind  these guys will treat them like garbage and wont even bother giving them information in a good way.\nIts my humble request to BMTC to give some training to the conductors to talk nicely to the passengers so that people will love catching public transport instead of avoiding it.,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Person falling in Manhole
The area outside Passport Office (Ejipura) has been an open dump for a long time. It is the intersection of 3 BBMP wards - Neelsandra (Ward No 116)  Ejipura (Ward No 148) and Adugodi (Ward No 147) represented by Lokesh  P.M.Saroja and S.M.Murugesh Modaliyar respectively. The waste is dumped there by the residents of Rajendra Nagar due to an inadequacy in door-to-door collection. Moreover  several hotels and establishments dump their waste at this location over night. BBMP also parks their trucks and compactors in this area and it is a transfer point for door-to-door collection. All this coupled together have made this a black spot with lots of garbage  stray animals and an open urinal. Could the BBMP take care of some basic things like - 1. Park 3-4 compactors at the spot at night in a way such that people who come to dump can directly throw into the compactors and not on the ground. 2. Appoint a night watchmen (7 PM - 7 AM) who would ensure anyone who comes to dump at night throws it into the compactors and not on the ground. 3. Observe the bulk generators who dump them at night and handle them as per the law. 4. Improve the number and frequency of door to door collection by consulting the locals for timings best suited to them. 5. Beautify the place. 6. Make people use the Sulabh Sounchalaya available right across the road instead of defecating/urinating in the open.

In our beloved complaint generating Outer Ring Road (ORR)  i think on an average 1 bus stops every 2 - 5 mins  yet shockingly one doesnt find a designated bus-stop from near Iblur camp (Sarjapur road) till upto Karthiknagar  which is around 7 kms away. So what buses do is  stop just before a flyover or where people gather (ex  In front of New Horizon college). Imagine thousands of people stand in one of the most important corridors in India on the road randomly  waiting for a bus. BMTC  i think should be responsible for deciding and building bus-stops but there is no action whatsoever from their end.\nNow to mention the problems as a result of not having designated bus-stops\n1. Bus stops where people stand rather than the other way around\n2. Stopping right before/after a flyover ensures that the buses stop in the narrowest part of the road  hence successfully slowing traffic and creating a traffic jam\n3. People do not have a shelter to stand under\n4. Its just unbelievable that this has not been addressed till now\n\nHope this soon gets fixed and helps civilians and drivers.,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Person falling in Manhole

Sai green apartment road  Flower Garden  1st Cross  whole street have became dumpster. People don't have awareness (literally no awareness and common sense) regarding garbage disposal. People just bring there garbage and through in over fences in near by lake. That too as open garbage (i.E not even packed and tied in polythene)  which get spread all over and stink like anything. Plus as its over fences cleaning guys cant get rid of it completely.     Suggested solution is to have one time thoroughly cleaning and create some kind of holder/poster/sign board explaining not to through garbage over fences  just tie garbage up in polythene and put it on designated place  so garbage van can come and collect it (provided allocation for dedicated garbage van at-least once or twice a week). Such holder/poster/sign board can be hanged over fences around the lake. Also these sign boards shall be more graphical rather than textual  so citizen with all language can follow it. If people can take personal responsibility and increase awareness it can be achieved.,Providing removing replacing dustbins,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Collection point not attended properly

They are now operating between 5 AM till 10 PM  and they have just extended few walls. But this isnt helping much. The excruciating noise being created is disturbing \n\nthe normal peace of healthy human beings  and to live in peace is rights of human. This noise is having adverse effects of rendering us with personality disorders  loss \n\nof focus and anti-social thinking.\n\n2. We believe such a noise creating industry should not be allowed to be present in the middle of residential establishments. If you look around (or visit near the big \n\npark near by)  you will notice that the noise is heard among long distances. Some residents (individual houses) might not have reported about it since they might not be \n\naware of online registrations or due to the presence of fear. And some flats have confined themselves with glass walls which is not even letting air come in.\n\n3. The timing of the industry is 5 AM till 10 PM  which is not as per the industry standards.\nYou are the authorities and you know very well about it  and the same is reiterated in the below link that normal working hours should not exceed 9 hours in a day and \n\n48 hours in a week.

Take a drive in the residential areas of Marathahalli (Ward No 86)  and see  the pathetic condition of the roads.    \n\nThey are in a very bad shape with huge potholes everywhere.

When there is bright sunshine   dust billows into the air  and  occupies every  house  thereby cleaning  the house at regular intervals  has become  compulsory  to remove the dusts.

Because of this the govt or bbmp took some action like painting 3 religion god pics so that people don't dirty the place and also fine for throwing garbage there.   This was of no use at all even after all this people throw grabages on roads n other places the reason being there's no vehicle that comes to the houses every day and the residents can't stuff the wastes at home for such a long time.       When govt is doing so many things for keeping the city clean they have to be more concerned on what's the reason for dumping them outside its as simple that there's no daily service as said that the bbmp vehicle will arrive at your doorstep and pls throw your garbages into it. I hope the area will remain clean if the vehicles are sent everyday. I'm cent percent sure people will not even think of throwing the garbages in public. The main bus stop there stinks so badly there are hundreds of students and workers who come there for buses and mostly children will be affected because of this. And I'm pretty sure people know that there are only increase in number of diseases no matter what the reason is.,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Providing removing replacing dustbins,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point

The traffic signal opposite Gopalan Arch Mall  RR Nagar (Mysore Road junction) is routinely violated by both heavy and light vehicles. This causes traffic issues at this junction. Many times  though there is a traffic policeman at this point  he is unable to note down these daily violators. These people vroom inches past people who are respecting the signal  which can lead to an accident.    I request the Bangalore Traffic Police to set up a camera to catch these violations  and fine the motorists. This will not only ensure smooth traffic  but also ensure that people learn to respect traffic rules and safety.,Person falling in Manhole,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property

It is an interesting topic of the time  but never existed 15 to 20 years ago. If one can view the areal view of the city / ward/ post office area etc 20 years ago and compare the view of today  the answer is very simple. The argument against dogs(stray and pet) are against the dogs  but against the civic habits of the residents.(1) every inch of the residential site and encroached roads are cemented (2)the pets are not provided the basic comforts and facilities needed (3) waste food are thrown outside on the street regularly attracts stray dogs  as seen in the photos of the article.(4) then the stray dogs defecate on the facing side of the road  more fed more defecate(5)  Added by pets  the owners do not have the needed facility  but still have one or few  that amounts to equal in number if not more of stray dogs  as nothing is provided by owner except the feeds. There could be few exemptions  but in real term stray and pet are alike and equal in nuisance to residents.\nSolution:\n1. Pets should be licensed at hefty fee with exclusive facility at owners place\n2. Stray can be fed by residents within their own campus  not on the street\nAbove should be tried first and amend suitably later.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Also  enforce the rules by checking that cars and autos are following your rules.\n2) Move the bus stop before or after the narrow portion of the road\n3) Please make sure that autos do not stand in a disorderly fashion and add to the congestion.\n\nI have sent an email complaint to the Jayanagar traffic police station more than 5 times.

Marathahalli residential areas (Ward No 86) have almost become a living hell. The residents here are staring at death traps on roads. Loose gravel scattered around due to frequent movement of water tankers and school buses on these roads pose a threat to smaller vehicles and the thick clouds of dust are suffocating. Because of so much dust coming out of the mud roads  the pollution level is very high. Every turn is virtually a death trap. When there is bright sunshine  dust billows into the air and occupies every house  thereby cleaning the house at regular intervals has become compulsory to remove the dusts. Even a brief spell of rain becomes a nightmare for pedestrians. Residents here are tired of complaining to the civic authorities to asphalt the roads which has not been done for the past more than 10 years now. Numerous complaints to BBMP have only fallen on deaf ears. Why cannot BBMP attends to civic woes on time? Why do they wait for accidents and deaths to happen to wake up?,Pollution due to chemical effluents,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Unauthorised storage of explosives

Area: Near 20th L Cross  Anjaneya Swamy layout  Ejipura - 560047\nThe moment we take a turn next to Bata showroom  a foul smell greets you. There is a big sewer line but than we all know that there is no alternative. Hence we have to bear that.\nThe real menace is created by a Cow barn which you will find if you keep going straight on that road. Every morning the owner of that barn will unleash all the cows from the barn. All these cows will then roam around in the area even reaching Sony world signal sometimes. These cows will block the road  spread dung everywhere on the roads and block traffic. We already know the poor infrastructure that we have in Bangalore. But this makes it even worse.\nDuring rains  this becomes even worse. The dung will mix with the water and make the roads and nearby areas stink like anything. No way this area looks like a residential area.\n\nI understand that it may not be possible to move this barn from here but atleast the owner can be given strict warning for not letting the cows wander on the roads.\nA city is as good as its people.

All BMTC buses and other Passenger vehicles should not  be allowed to stop  on Ring Road  they should be strictly given bays on Service roads only! \n2. For all the Employees and other people who get down to enter Manyata should be provided with a Foot Over bridge across the Ring Road. This resolves 75% of the mess!\n3. For people who are leaving from Tech park and buses from Hebbal side should also be Halted only on Service Roads Strictly\n4.

Instead bwssb can empower consumer to self report for online bill payment and have occasional audits done to ensure users are compliance. This will help bwssb to collect money timely to improve its function and also save users time to walk into bwssb offices.
