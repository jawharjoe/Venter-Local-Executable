Unfortunately  even after going to the depth of 1100 feet  the yield is only 1\"" water which no where near the required quantity of water to meet the lay out requirement.  \nSo the boring was stopped. Subsequently one more location in our lay out \n( 1st cross road) where the yield is expected to be more was identified thru survey and we approached our corporator for sinking a bore at the new location. However he expressed inability to take up one more boring due to lack of funds. \nHence we residents of this lay out request BWSSB & other authorities in State Govt.  to come to rescue by sinking a bore at the identified location \n( 1 st cross in our lay out). \n\nRequest concerned authorities to take up the work immediately  to solve our water problems."

The tenant of this house is least bothered even though she runs a wellness clinic on residential property.  Not sure who will advise her not to throw waste and create nuisance.  Dried Coconut leaves are put in front of the house as she needs to park her car on the footpath .  Also the house has illegal washing platform adjacent to the compound where all the water is left outside the compound and on the road.   So far there is no action taken even after complaining to the authorities.        Will any of the authorities take care of these violations.   Please let me know whom should i approach to get this sorted out.
