Delay in delivery,No Signal/Unable to use,Wrong/Faulty product,"Dear
sir this is your products delivery my home address not a delivery plz sir plz  problem solved resolved"
Delay in delivery,Bad food,Wrong/Faulty product,This order is delayed and being handled very carelessly. The delivery boy called me to confirm the address and I told him the place where he had to come. He thereafter neither came at the place  nor he telephoned me. He rather rescheduled the delivery. This is very disappointing at your end. I will complaint against the delivery boy and Flipkart regarding this to every possible authority.
