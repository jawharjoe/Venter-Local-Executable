Bad Patches,Respected Sri Vijaya Kumar \nThis is to highlight the fact that even around your office in 4th T Block  the cleanliness of the streets and collection of garbage is very poor. Please take a look next to the temple behind your office and see the permanent garbage pile which stinks nonstop. Please see how garbage is merely swept up into piles all over 33-36 Cross / 22nd - 18th Main areas (all around your office) instead of being collected by the sweepers and by the garbage autos. This is prime area with judges  senior executives  industrialists etc staying here (although everyone has the right to a clean street!)

Bad Patches,NGEF Road coming on to Old Madras Road: There are no markings for a stop line  or pedestrian crossing  on NGEF road. Since there is no stop line marked  the stop line is up to the imagination of impatient drivers. During the absence of a police person  the impatient drivers encroach and fill the slowest lane of Old Madras Road (OMR). This makes it hard for a \nmotorist travelling east on the slowest (leftmost) lane (OMR)  who must change over the middle east-bound OMR lane. Further  if the lights just change from green to red (there appears to be a very short change-over time I noted few weeks ago)  on east-bound OMR  slowest lane  the impatient drivers on NGEF road already proceed in south direction. This makes chances of an accident very high.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n 1. Draw stop line  pedestrian crossing lines  on South-bound NGEF road.\n 2. Check traffic light switch-over timings (when in automatic mode) at NGEF/OMR intersection.\n\nBEBEFIT:\n 1. Makes it better for pedestrians  East bound traffic on OMR  and for police to manage.\n 2. Safety/accident prevention.\n\n(If someone has photos they can load of the intersection  it will be very helpful)\n\nThank you.,Bad Patches,Drainage chokes and blockages,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Private Land   Building   Society   Factories,Despite the mostly one  or two  guards  people can still end up in the tracks either by design  or by accident  when a metro train comes.\n(The situation is not very different than this week\'s tragic Delhi Zoo incident). The risk of people falling into the track is higher when more people start using the metro.\n\nShould/when this happens  the only thing an ordinary guard is most likely to do is to blow his whistle. I do not believe the ordinary guards \nare trained to  or will be inclined to  get on an electrified track on the path of an oncoming train to save someone. Prevention is the best way. \nMechanisms are available to make it hard for people to jump or fall to the track altogether. Examples of automated barriers  used in the Singapore Metro  are attached. Bangalore Metro can take the lead  and set example in safety. It is better to install prevention mechanisms sooner  than later.\n\nMentioning for Byappanahalli Metro Station.

Unauthorised construction development,"On a recent interaction with the Indiranagar RTO  I noticed that seating capacity was only for about five (ordinary) customers. However  I would conservatively estimate the average number of customers at the RTO to be  say sixty. Dividing 60 by 5  we get 12. I would interpret this to mean that the RTO is operating in twelve times less space (for ordinary customers) than what it should be. The RTO must be in this building since the last 30 or more years. During my three visits to the RTO  I must have visited seven to eight different counters  and waited in at least five different queues.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n1. Can the RTO move into a new space where the LAYOUT is such that a large number of customers (say two hundred chairs are there) sit in the center  and all counters are in the periphery? This setup  or layout  would be similar to the setup in a \""railway ticket booking center\""  or ICICI bank.\nQueue numbers can be given out on a fisrt-come-first-serve basis via a machine  or manually.\n\n2. Can the RTO re-engineer their PROCESSES so that the customer can get their work done by going to any one of multiple one window only Technology will need to be used here.\n\nBENEFIT:\n1.

Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,I am staying near Netaji Circle and recently they did a Good thing of not allowing public to put waste in the road. It is really needed. But the authority should come and collect the waste from the apartment. If we are inside the apartment we won\'t know if someone is in the road to collect waste. I happen to see they come around 6 AM in the morning and people like me come from Night shift and will be sleeping. It is becoming difficult for us. \n\nThey could charge the apartment people some nominal fee say around 30-50 per month for collecting the waste.

Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,I have one idea in my mind regarding garbage disposal in Bangalore. I see large heaps of garbage disposed open around the roads and corners in the city that give it a horrible sight. \nWe can start one campaign wherein each company can contribute to donate one large bin for waste disposal. The waste can be collected by the BBMP on daily basis as they usually do. \nWe always expect BBMP to take action for everything which I feel is helpless due to shortage of funds or other reasons. This initiative will at least raise a sense of responsibility among the corporates in city  who can make big change by contributing a bit to maintain the beauty of the city. I am writing this in hope that this will be taken up as a city wide campaign to make a change.\nThanks and regards \nAnita Kalia,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage lorry not reported for service

Odour  foul smell  from drains,From past 2 weeks  our neighbourhood(Talacauvery nagar and Veerabhadra nagar) is receiving Cauvery water with green colour organic content in it.

Bad Patches,This is to mention about the lack of roads/road full of potholes in the stretch from HAL signal to the BEML gate   approximately around 2 kms.  There is absolutely no road at all in that 2 km stretch and this is absolutely difficult for a two wheeler commuter to pass through if a big vehicle like a bus passes by as the road is half the size of a normal road and due to the dust arose by the passing of the bus.  Half of the road is covered with barricades  for no reason which makes it only one way for most part of it.   And once you reach the Jeevan Bhima Nagar road   after that there are so many piles of stones created due to the process of laying Road activity which had started three months back and left in between.Since there are no streetlights too in this 3/4th of a km passage it makes it extremely difficult for one to spot the road which doesnt have a stone/hole in it.  To make it worse the BMTC buses coming from the opposite side [BEML bus stop] come in the wrong way[due to the non-existence of a road] resulting in chaos.,Bad Patches,Sweeping of road,Minor repairs to municipal property

BWSSB dug up the road and never asphalted it  leaving the road in such a bad shape that vehicles literally crawl everyday. The potholes are so dangerous that every day at least 10 bikers and 5 autos fall  which is too vulnerable for accidents.  Adding to it  the road from Lal Bahdur shastri nagar has opened which causes more traffic jam near the nice road junction  and no traffic police will come and clear the mess. Request concerned officials immediately asphalt the road properly  just fixing potholes will not serve the cause.,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property,Minor repairs to municipal property

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,There are about 30-40 Software companies in RMZ ecospace  Pritech and other tech parks in the area. People coming from the Silk board direction and going towards Marathalli side have to cross the road to catch a bus or to enter the tech park. Since this is Outer Ring road  there will be a lot of high speed traffic. Between 8-11 AM and 5-7 PM  lot of people cross the road. This leads to a lot of traffic jam and also poses a great risk to people crossing the road. The solution proposed is to construct a skywalk in the mentioned location.This will drastically reduce the risk to pedestrians\' lives and reduce traffic problem.

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,The night photo taken from inside the car is at 100 feet road  and CMH Road junction  in Indiranagar; on CMH Road  facing East  towards CMH hospital. The issue is that the count-down time display is not visible due to a solid tree-branch obstructing the driver\'s view. This non-visibility of signal count-down timer  causes un-necessary anxiety among already impatient Bangalore motorists.\n\n(Another photo is of the counter taken during day is also attached)\n\nThe responsible authorities are requested to address the issue of signal change count-down non-visibility  from CMH road  facing CMH hospital at this junction. My suggestion is that some **mechanical fixtures to used to re-locate the counter to a visible location  and the tree branch not be harmed**.\n\nHaving a signal count-down timer visible from CMH Road  facing CMH hospital  will serve the purpose it was meant to serve. \n\nIt is again requested that the tree not be harmed. Repeat: request tree not be harmed.\n\nThank you.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Municipal Plot
Hawkers,BACKGROUND: \nSince the metro commissioned and Byappanahalli Metro station inaugurated  my family  I and others have the reason to cross Old Madras Road (OMR). While the metro station is very nice  and the metro convenient  crossing Old Madras Road  is not easy. This is especially hard for the elderly  those with children  and dangerous for all pedestrians. Many school children also take the metro  and cross old madras road. Apart from watching out to avoid on-road traffic while crossing  there is a bus stop where buses come towards pedestrians  parked vehicles coming in  or starting out (some coming to visit food vendors)  which make it a fairly harrowing experience for pedestrians to cross the road  especially during peak hours.\n\nIn addition  the driving is tense for motorists (on OMR  as well as the side road)  as there is vehicular traffic  as well as  pedestrians (who may cross anywhere on the road) at this junction. \n\nSome photographs of the junction are attached.\n\nDespite the Byappanahalli Metro Station and service  the last mile connectivity for pedestrians needs some more work.\n\nI had written to BMRCL and a couple of BBMP officials inquiring about plans for a skywalk  and got no response. On asking Byannapahalli Namma Metro Customer Care  I was informed they are not aware of any pedestrian sky-bridge across from this metro station for C V Raman Nagar.\n\nACTION NEEDED:\n It is requested that a pedestrian skywalk be built across Old Madras Road to access the Byappanahalli Metro station  bus-stops across the street. Apart from stairs  ramps are also requested to be incorporated into the pedestrian sky-bridge as it will make it easy for wheel-chair bound commuters  families with young children (pushing strollers)  or those passengers with light wheelable luggage). A drawing proposal is attached in this regard. (Pavement space right across from Byappanahalli Metro station is narrow. Therefore the pedestrian skywalk will need to be off-set a bit. Roof  and efficient lighting are assumed).\n\n(BTW  the Swami Vivekananda Pedestrian Skywalk is very convenient for normally abled pedestrians to cross Old Madras Road. An image example of a staircase + ramp pedestrian skybridge from IMM  near Jurong East  Singapore is attached)\n\nAt the same time  authorities could look to de-congest the intersection  by creating designated space for different activities  to avoid traffic bottlenecks.\n\nBENEFIT\n The following benefits are envisioned once a pedestrian sky-bridge is put in place: \n  1. Pedestrian safety => MOST IMPORTANT\n  2. Metro and bus commuter convenience\n  3. Driver comfort of motorists on OMR and S.G.Palya Roads\n  4. Smoother transportation flow & better quality of life for all\n\nThank you!,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches

Drainage chokes and blockages,Respected Sir  I would like to bring this to your notice that the drainage (5X5 feet approx) next to my compound is left open. The other part of the drainage is covered and is used as a foot path having gaps in between  which is enough for a person to fall. During monsoon this area being low lying gets submerged under water causing grave danger to the pedestrian  who mistakenly walk on this path which may be fatal.

The mainly under the yeshwanthpur metro station as the water leaks from the pipes many times and erode the roads causing potholes and the potholes are filled multiple times but the water leakage is yet to be addressed. if the department can fill the potholes multiple times spending lot of money instead they can address the cause and give a end to it instead of filling potholes every now and then. most times they are not addressed till months. i have seen this issue in the whole NH4 Highway. service road are also worst and yet to be addressed,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property,Minor repairs to municipal property

Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,This is right beside the wall of the Isolation hospital and behind the S.V.Road metro station  next to an auto garage. The garbage gets collected in the mornings in a small van with small rakes and dust collectors when really it needs a large truck and giant collector. Anyway  the garbage comes right back in half an hour  because people from the nearby slum New Byapanahalli walk over and chuck stuff-- factory residue  old clothes  discarded food  directly on to the street. The rest of the day you have numerous cows  dogs  crows. In the past this was not a residential neighborhood  now the buildings are right next to it. This location is actually the wrong location-- it blocks the street (along with trucks and buses belonging to an illegal building that was recently demolished on 1st Cross)  birds fly up to our balconies with food bits  and there are numerous flies. Being right next to the Isolation hospital it also must affect their hygiene. Since the garbage comes from the colony at the other end of the street it should be moved making it more convenient for them  and hopefully they will then place it into the correct space rather than throw garbage like projectiles  splashing open everywhere.

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,I felt I must share a pertinent issue being faced by many commuters in Whitefield  and a possible solution with you. Please read this and share your thoughts on how we can take this forward.  Issue: As a daily commuter from Whitefield Hoskote Main Road to EPIP Industrial area  my journey that should take less than 20 mins  is now crossing 1.5hrs (in the morning around 9 am onwards). The reason is the traffic jam starting from Hope Farm junction  continuing till ITPL. Cars  Trucks  Water tankers  Cabs  Volvos â€“ all are crammed one behind the other and inch forward at less than a snailâ€™s pace. To add to the woes  a large portion of the ITPL main road has been dug up  further reducing the width of the road by half. This is not a sustainable situation and I shudder to think what will happen once the metro construction starts in Whitefield.  Solution: Instead of all cars being forced to use the ITPL main road  I came across this road called â€˜Hoodi Sadaramangala roadâ€™  which is the mud road that runs parallel to the railway track  from Kadugodi to Hoodi. This road is currently in very bad shape as it is a mud road and it is extremely bumpy if traveled on in a car. It is unusable on a daily basis  as of now. The good news  however  is that it provides a quick commute to Hoodi circle  bypassing all roadblocks  and the distance is hardly 5 km. From Hoodi  it is very easy to reach the EPIP area. If we can somehow get the BBMP authorities to tar up this arterial road  I believe we will have many happy commuters  fewer jams on the main roads and most of all  peace of mind for people at forced to go through Hope Farm Junction.    Update: I have posted a photo taken a day ago of the current road condition,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Unauthorised construction development

Minor repairs to municipal property,We are the residents of Vadderapalya living with pitiable amenities in this area.Our road conditions are pathetic with big big pot holes.As such there is no road at all  connected roads are from Vadderaplaya bus stop till Sai garden layout no access of roads at all.If rain comes   to reach main road  it will be an exploratory for vehicle commuters.All vehicle commuters   in specific night to drive very complicated since there is no street lights as well ion the road.We are clue less why BBMP authorities  are completely ignored our area.This area is very far for development.Not only roads there are no streetlights as well  for pedestrians to walk in the night time will be terrible due to snakes as well street dogs.Many school buses /vans are coming inside the layout to pick the child  horrific times for drivers as well child due to pathetic road conditions.Now a days drivers are agreeing to come inside the layout and pick the child due to dreadful roads.Vehicle commuters will be obvious where the potholes will be  it will be completely blind drive.Also in summer season   mosquitoes  are spread in entire area.After 6 pm to walk on the streets will be a dangerous experience. Since there is a open drain going very close to residential layouts .Due to this mosquitoes are spread in this area  different kind of diseases are scattering in this locality.We never saw mosquito fogging is going in this area.Also garbage /waste dump yards became more in this area   since there garbage vehicle not coming regularly.There is no other option for residents   wherever there is empty place garbage is developing in a steep.Our locality is very close to city limits and also there is school as well however  BBMP authorities completely ignored our area. Finallly we residents are request BBMP authorities to provide basic amenities/facilities in our area.,Minor repairs to municipal property,Proper electric supply to municipal properties,Person falling in Manhole

Major repairs to municipal property,Ambedkar Nagar  Whitefield saw a series of road digging around 8 months back. The roads were completely dug and left like that. Now there exist no road in the entire colony of Ambedkar Nagar. This area inspite of being in the center of all IT companies has open sewage system. This area is also left untouched from the Kaveri Water or any water supply in particular.

Garbage not lifted from house gully,Serenity Layout near Hegde Nagar Bangalore North Zone has No proper Sewage Drain facility  No Garbage disposal facility  No Roads  No Drinking water   No street lights from past 10 years. In the recent past around 3 months back BBMP & KRIDL has sanctioned a project work from HEGDE NAGAR to K.NARAYANAPURA MAIN ROAD which passes through my layout for RAIN Water drain facility which was not very important as of now in this area since ours is not a low level area with Flood issues. The workers have cut down trees  dug up all the rain water drain which was already existing by damaging private property compound walls & BESCOM Electricity wires  BSNL Telephone wires  Bore-well water connections etc.  which has caused very inconvenience & discomfort to the residence of this area. My point here is WHY don\'t BBMP & KRIDL put together focus on projects which are really CRITICAL & useful to public like Sewage  Drinking Water  Road  Sanitation etc.  rather than wasting Money  Manpower  Time & Effort on Non-Critical issues like one mentioned above. I have spoken to all possible officials of both BBMP & KRIDL regarding the same but ended up in going in rounds and rounds explaining the same to all of them with no OUTCOME or proper VALID answer. I am not even sure if this digging up work was planned & approved as per guideline because nobody has a letter or blue print plan copy to justify. Kindly would request the concerned dept to take ownership & responsibility in addressing my complaint asap.,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Odour  foul smell  from drains,Sweeping of road

This is causing lot of traffic and also pollution in and around the place. The roads have been improved outside the Bus stop  but inside the bus stop it is totally filthy and ill maintained. I have also posted complaints few times before  but i see that no action was taken. Since this bus stop has private buses as well as BMTC buses  it is causing lot of problems there.,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,The road in front of K.R Puram railway station is congested due to heavy traffic  bus stops  and people crossing the road. The situation becomes ugly when a train arrives at K.R Puram station.  There is no foot path in front of   railway station and whatever small foot path existing near the bus stops are used by shops and street vendors and a railway booking counter.  This area  is too overcrowded with people. All the buses/taxis/autos/many private vehicles stop here to collect people  making walking in this area extremely dangerous.  This stretch of road is filthy due to people urinating  spitting  dumping plastic tea cups and due to the foul smell from the railway tracks.

Unauthorised construction development,We (Sobha Lavender apartments) had applied for Cauvery water connection in 2008. The applicable fees had also been paid as per the revised norms. However  there has been no sign of the water supply so far. Just now there is some news of this connection being serviced. We are being asked to pay for a service connection line (4 inch dia)  from the feeder line (1 foot dia) to our property. Since the BWSSB has not laid the feeder line under our road  we are being told that we need to pay for the service connection from the feeder line which is at a disctance of more than 100 metres. !! This is 6 to 10 times more than what every other apartment building is required to pay for. Is it not the responsibility of BWSSB to lay the feeder line(1 foot dia) along every road ?

Even if we stop people  they are arguing saying earlier the garbage bin was here and they dump the garbage there and go.\n\n6. Since a lot of hardwork is done  the road is made very neat and clean  painted and footpath is made by BBMP  still people are not following the discipline.\n\n7. We were happy to see after so many years  there is improvement on our road and the garbage-bin is removed so that kids can play infront of our building and mosquitoes will be reduced but the people around are not following discipline as they are saying that there is no other place to put the garbage and BBMP vehicle does not stop at each building for long time. And it comes too early to wake-up and throw the garbage.\n\n8. Solution:\na. I request BBMP Officials  to send vehicle to each and every building for collecting garbage  alert the people and inform them untill they follow them. \n\nb. Also to place a notice board by BBMP - \""Not to throw or dump garbage here. The people who throw/dump garbage will be fined.\""\n\nPlease look into this matter as they are not disciplined and not maintaining the neatness in the locality.\n\nThanking you !!!",Garbage not lifted from house gully,Providing removing replacing dustbins,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,This seems to be a perennial problem in Koramangala. People stopping at the signals on the other side of the road and blocking the on coming traffic. What is surprising is that the traffic police does NOTHING about it. What right do these people have? The main offenders are bikes and taxis with a splattering of private vehicles and sometimes even a police van. What is the traffic police there for? Why are they not  either sending these vehicles back to join the regular flow or fining them for traffic violations? Are these people special because they are taxis and 2 wheelers? Do they have seperate rules for them? One of the main reasons for traffic chaos in this city is because the police do not fine people violating rules because they are BUSY checking for documents and collecting fines rather than directing traffic. As per the rules and a statement made by the traffic police department  the no traffic police is not supposed to stop vehicles for checking documents unless they have broken a rule. But who listens to them when they themselves break all rules!!! \nThe attached image was taken this afternoon at the signal near Ooty Chocolate on 8th Main Road  4th Block  Koramangala.\nWILL THE TRAFFIC POLICE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SO THAT THERE IS SOME ORDER IN THIS CHAOTIC CITY???,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,This is regarding the perpetually growing traffic problem in front of Manyata Tech Park. The road leading to the Nagawara Signal is not just pothole filled but also has no functional footpaths(pavements). Multitudes of pedestrians from Manyata Tech Park and others find themselves having to walk on the road as a result of this. To top it all  there are several cars and bikes parking themselves unauthorized in front of the restaurants such as Biryani House and others. The pedestrians in an effort to circumvent this  walk on the roads creating further blockage. This reaches painful heights during the rains. Every day several vehicles narrowly escape what could possibly be grievous injuries.    Recommended Solution:     This is a request to BBMP â€“ Corporator  Sub-inspector-Traffic and MLA to fix the pavements outside Manyata Tech Park where 1.35 Lakh people work for our city. Below are the solutions recommended:    1. Clear all encroachments  2. Lay the payments from Manyata Tech Park Gates to Nagavara Circle  3. Not allow unallocated parking near restaurants such as Biryani House and others  4. Not allow buildings nearby to encroach our pavements  5. Fix the potholes on the road from Manyata Tech Park to Nagavara Circle  6. For traffic taking coming from Manyata and taking U-Turn at Nagavara Circle to go towards Hebbal â€“  Break open and make way under the Flyover so that traffic smoothly flows.   7. Lay to Service Road from Nagavar Circle to BEL Office â€“ this will help ease a lot of traffic that is unduly stopping to pick up people on ring road    Looking forward to response from BBMP â€“ Corporator  Sub-inspector-Traffic and MLA.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain",Drainage chokes and blockages

Minor repairs to municipal property,BBMP has given permission to construct several apartments in Tubarahalli next to Kundalahalli gate signal without proper commutable road. Two famous schools are functioning beside this road. As per BBMP  this is not a public road. Residents of this road & school goers have protested (Satyagraha) in 2013 & BBMP assured us in writing that this road work will start in Oct 2013 & complete within Dec 2013. Even corporator (Mr Sreedhar reddy-Ward No.85 Doddanekkundi)& MLA(Arvind Limbavali) inaugurated the road in Nov 2013 & assured that the road with drainage & street lights will be completed within 4-6 months. But till now the road work is not completed. Many private landlords are claiming that portion of the road is not public property & is their property. 4-5 notice boards have come up claiming that land is their property & obstructing the road work. It is the BBMP & Govt responsibility to aqquire the land & construct the road for public use as there is no other approach road for the residents to go to the main road. We have given memorandum to Cheif minister  MLA  MP  corporator  BBMP joint commissioner  Mahadevpura long back. But only false assurances  no progress.\nPortion of the road was tarred in January 1st week  2015. The road work was approved for an estimated cost of Rs 1.5Crores. Drainage work was also incomplete. Only half the road has street lights. Many are not working.How BBMP & politicians are not providing the basic infrastructure to the residents here & we are all paying property tax on time to BBMP.

Silt to be lifted on road,The lake in Somsundarapalya  HSR layout  sector 2 is more of a dumping ground and urinal than a lake. Known as the city of lakes  it is a shame to have such an ill-maintained and dirty lake around. People use this lake to dump their garbage and to relieve themselves. There are 2 temples in close vicinity of the lake  just imagine what is being done to the sanctity of these temples. \nI sincerely urge the authorities to consider redevelopment of the lake and making this place one of beauty and for recreation. The kaikondrahalli lake at sarjapur road is a classic example of a redeveloped and reclaimed lake. Hope this petition finds enough supporters to consider the lake improvement program. Many people living in and around the area would benefit from the fresh air and beauty of the lake if reclaimed and redeveloped.,Silt to be lifted on road,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Drainage chokes and blockages

Bad Patches,"BACKGROUND and SITUATION:\nThe venue is a Y-shape junction  where vehicles of all sizes arrive. The vehicles usually go in either left  or right  in a \""free-for-all\"" manner. As seen in the pictures motorists wait at the intersection of the junction  to get across  thereby blocking other vehicles that could cross. This results in a jam  or grid-lock. This jam occurs very frequently  multiple times a day  especially when the traffic is more. I have seen a police-man help direct traffic during the evening peak hours. This helps.\n\nHowever  should the police-man not be there at this junction  say during a rain-storm  then the traffic situation at this junction is a complete mess.\n\nThe root cause of this grid-lock  in my opinion  is two-fold: \n1. Systemic (no one knows who has right of way)  and \n2. Behaviour (lack of courtesy to other drivers  and pedestrians) by the motorists.\n\nAbout five pictures of the symptoms are attached.\n\nACTION REQUESTED:\nAs seen in the attached diagram  I am proposing the following  be tried as a pilot solution:\n1. Paint a hatched-line \""No waiting\"" or \""Keep Clear\"" area on the intersection. (I recall seeing such a thing at Minsk square a few years ago). I believe these are usually are yellow in colour. A pictorial symbol of \""No waiting\"" will be helpful since not everyone maybe able to read a certain language. A clear \""STOP\"" line also needs to be marked.\n2. There are few buildings with blank walls at the intersecion. My recommendation is \""STOP\"" symbols be painted on all  three walls  with the following INTERSECTION COURTESY/RIGHT OF WAY RULE FOR MOTORISTS can be written below  preferably in PICTURE form  in a manner that the symbol and rules are clearly visible to drivers arriving from all three sides:\n a) Give way to pedestrians (who have first right of way)\n b) Motorist coming to intersection first has right of way\n c) If two motorists come to the intersection at the same time  the it is the motorist on the left who gets right of way\n d) If three motorists come to the intersection at the same time  courtesy pays... let one go first  and then the  motorist on the left etc. \n\nOnce such a system is put in place  a police-person could still be there to facilitate  and educate the people. Hopefully  the police-person\'s job will be a little easier once these are in place.\n\nNote: The courtesy rules may need to be illuminated in order to be visible in poor light conditions.\n\nBENEFIT:\n* A pilot system in place.\n* Traffic rules for this intersection clear to drivers  and pedestrians.\n* Hopefully  a smoother flow of traffic \n* Life is a little easier for the police-person  and also for pedestrians and drivers.\n\nBased on the outcome of this  if successful  such methods could be piloted for many other similar intersections in Bangalore also.",Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain"

For quite some time now construction wastes / building debris were being clandestinely dumped along both sides of the access road  as is evident from the huge quantities of such debris / garbage dumps that have accumulated & now litter the area. Even  household garbage/ human waste are also being surreptitiously dumped.\n\nSir  the entire area  in question   has become infested with vermin  polluted & the environment totally degraded & unsanitary   so as to pose serious health hazards  not only to all the residents of these campuses & the Avalahalli village  who  per force  have to make use of  the said access road but also  to the large number of  students  who attend the Presidency School. We are sorely afraid of a serious EPIDEMIC  breaking out   due to the totally unsanitary   unhygienic & polluted environment of the area.\n\nMoreover  very poor  illumination during the night due to insufficient street lights  make it unsafe for residents to commute  especially women & children.\n\nSIR  we humbly submit this PETITION to your good offices to kindly arrange for Proper Construction & Asphalting of the said only Link / Access Road leading to AVALAHALLI VILLAGE  at your very earliest convenience  on SOS basis and save the said residents from further distress.\n\nWe thank you in anticipation of your positive dispensation and look forward to the URGENT Construction & Asphalting of the road & the Roadside kerbs & also installation of proper street lighting.\n\nThanking You                                                                                                                                                                                Yours Sincerely,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

"Removal of silt from nalla across culverts, etc.",Air pollution in and around Kundalahalli  Whitefield is aggravated by presence of Graphite India. While the company may have taken measures to reduce the pollution levels  it still largely contributes to making Whitefield a pollution hotspot. Children especially are the victims- they suffer from respiratory problems from the time they are toddlers. As a mother  their ill-health gives me sleepless nights. Just visit the RXDX clinic located opposite to Graphite India and you know what I am talking about. The air in the clinic is loaded with the pollution emanating from Graphite India and one comes out feeling irritation in the throat  coughing or sneezing. Either the authorities should not have permitted the growing of a township near such a polluting unit; but now that the township had been established  Graphite India needs to be relocated and quickly.,"Removal of silt from nalla across culverts, etc.",Drainage chokes and blockages,Person falling in Manhole
Unauthorised construction development,Ref: Ward: Dasarahalli Zone  Shettihalli Ward & Ward Number: 12 It has recently come to my attention that illegal construction is happened next my home. I live in #53  10th cross  Sapthagiri Layout  Chikkasandra  Bangalore-560057 next to my building  A Complex has been constructed and would like to lodge a complaint with the unsightly and unlawful building that has been getting constructed by violation of the law on the above premises by Mr.Venkatesh. The perpetrator of this illegal construction is Mr.Venkatesh who is extremely rude and hostile to me when I voiced my objection on the above construction. As per the permits in our area  once can construct a building max up to 2 or 2 and half floors. But this building is constructed 6 and half floors and one should leave an open space of 3 feet on all 4 sides of the building which is not there and the space left is less than half a feet. This building I has been constructed by occupying close to my wall even without half a feet and I am sure that this is not the approved plan sanctioned by BBMP. I hope you can spare some personnel to deal with this act of blatant lawlessness as soon as possible. Kindly take immediate action on this  which should be a lesson for others.

Proper electric supply to municipal properties,I live opposite to Bhuvaneswarinagar park 3rd main road  Banashankari 3rd stage  5th block  right opposite to my house there are street cart vegetable vendors who have positioned their shops right on the footpath blocking the pedestrian\'s right of walking on the footpath. This in turn is forcing the pedestrian\'s to walk on the street which is endangering their lives with risk of being involved in an accident by the vehicle\'s passing through this street.\n\nMoreover this is also creating an parking menace and people who come down to buy vegetables from these street cart vendors park their vehicles right in front of our house gates blocking us from taking out vehicles out of our house and also traffic on this small road has increased due to this. This is disturbing the peace of senior citizens in this locality. \n\nI also have seen a few months ago when BBMP team went on a breaking spree in our area trying to force legitimate shopkeepers from removing their selling articles placed in front of their shops and also breaking their over head plastic roofs which was extending outside their shops. This is much appreciated  but not sure why did they not also vacate these street vendors in front of our house. \n\nThis is not only creating a menace to us  but also to other fellow citizens whose lives are endangered as they cannot walk on this street. I urge BBMP to clear these street vendors from here and respect the fellow senior citizens right of peace.,Proper electric supply to municipal properties,Major repairs to municipal property,Minor repairs to municipal property

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Itâ€™s been almost 6 months since BWSSB has dugged out the Ejipura 20th C Cross road to lay sewage pipelines and nothing has been done apart from covering it with mud. It was terrible for the next few months to use that road  due to rain it was totally non-usable. Now  summer is here and I was hoping either BWSSB or BBMP will fix it(there was an agreement between BWSSB and BBMP that BBMP will fix the roads dugged out by BWSSB for lying of sewage pipelines). If the grossly mud was the problem during rains  it\'s now dust during summer. You must understand a large part of pollution is not caused only by vehicles  but by the dust which severely effects one\'s health. I request the concerned authority to look into this matter and fix the road ASAP. It is not only the matter of convenience but also of health of the people residing around.\n\nThanks\nNishanth Kesavan,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property

Then there are street vendors too  blocking pedestrian movement in this lane near the Metro station.\n\nWhy can\'t this narrow lane be made one way with one side parking and that too a little away from the metro station  so that there is some solace for the pedestrians?\n\nThere have been so many tweets and complaints regarding this lane  yet no action has been taken.

I have always noticed that ambulances get stuck in traffic and the culprits are the people outside the ambulance who really don't value others life. Inspite of the loud siren they put. I request you to make it compulsory for all government and private ambulances to have a camera recording of the journey they take while trying to save lives. In this process there will be documentary evidence of the people trying to obstruct work of the ambulance and necessary fine or social service by those obstructing can be done. It will be revolutionary step if taken now. This will be appreciated by everyone and in the future most will be educated and will have real concern a everyone will play their role in saving innocent lives. Hoping to see the change .

Unauthorised construction in slum,My netconnect number: 7483163551 was cancelled in the month of Jan-2014 because of the all the wrong and false information from the Reliance customer care. They made me to pay excess of Rs. 1500/1600 for activation of 3 months advance rental plan which was suppose to be Rs. 1000/- advance rental plan  and didn\'t activated but they were insisting me to pay more. So I denied and cancelled the connection  hence Reliance had to pay me back Rs.1100/- back after all the deduction they made and they said it will take 45 days to refund the amount. So I contacted the customer care after 45 days and customer care people denied to provide information on the cancelled connection and suggested to visit store. As suggested I visited Yelahanka New Town stores  where they said they also don\'t have information about the refund amount and said it will normally take 90 days and asked me to wait till April end. As suggested I waited till April end but no refund happened. Hence I visited their store again in May 1st week and they were renovating the store so told to visit some other time due to maintenance issue. So I visited today and still the store is renovating but they had a step up of store in the same building garage space. I went their and asked about the details and they said to contact customer care  which I did in front of them but it was no response from customer care and call went on hold for more then 25mins. So again I started to ask about the next escalation metrics where I can get the solution instead of visiting stores or calling customer care. They started saying they do not have any other solutions and they said they don\'t care about this issues and all. So an argument started between us and store owner came in and started threatening that he will beat me up in front of my mother  they even said that they will close the shutter and beat me up  so my mother got anxious and we had to leave the place as they were 3 people started abusing us and tried to hit also. But due to few other peoples interference they couldn\'t do anything  I even tried to take video of their rude attitude and misbehavior but couldn\'t. We wanted to file a criminal case but I don\'t wanted to because my mom was feeling uneasy about the situation and had to take her back home.

"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain",Marathahalli residential areas (Ward No 86) have almost become a living hell. Why so? It is because the residents here are staring at death traps on roads. Loose gravel scattered around due to frequent  movement of water tankers and school buses on these roads pose a threat to smaller vehicles and the thick clouds of dust are suffocating.  The rain and the deep potholes it has formed on the residential roads give us the jitters. Because of continuous rains thick slippery slush coats the roads  making it almost impossible to walk or ride 2 wheelers (see few photos attached herewith). The downpour has only worsened the condition. Residents here are tired of complaining to the civic authorities to asphalt the roads which has not been done for the past many years now.  Numerous complaints to BBMP have only fallen on deaf ears. Why  cannot BBMP attends to civic woes on time? Why do they wait for accidents and deaths to happen to wake up?,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain",Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation

If there is another train coming in opposite direction  atleast 30 mins is wasted here. During which the traffic piles upto Mysore road and interior roads which are narrow.

By the time entire metro is ready  looks like most of the ppl who are facing issues would retire :)\n\nJust by my rough calculation  it seems like the train starting from YPR can reach WFD within 40 mins.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

This is a very serious issue as lots of people who have relocating their houses to this area are seen surrendering their BSNL landlines and are very bothered about to find a internet connection. Even top class network providers like BSNL and Airtel doesn\'t have its feasibility in majority of the area. All the corresponding authorities blames the BDA who are delaying for permissions. A very underdeveloped area when it comes to telecom sectors. \n2. Garbage issues : There are a lot of garbage issues in the area. There is a garbage truck standing near 13th main  2nd stage. That is a dumping point for all BBMP to dump the locality\'s garbage. That stretch of road is unbearable to walk around because of a very bad odour  unhygienic environment  ad during rain the place becomes a nightmare. Its a same issue in most of the other places in the locality. \nAll i can say is the BDA or the BBMP body responsible for Kumaraswamy Layout is very irresponsible in its work.

Major repairs to municipal property,Sir  The road from Dodda Kammanahalli that leads to Bannerghatta Road is in very bad shape. There are pot holes all over the road. The roads are so terrible that  auto rickshaws demand double charges to ply on this road. The cab drivers from corporate office too refuse to drop employees to home as the road is in a bad shape. Kindly look into the issue. Even after posting this complaint 2 years back and with continuous issues being faced by residents in one or other ways  authorities have failed to show any result. I agree there is few work going on  but that is only adding fuel to fire. The best example was that of last week  where a woman fell off the bike and was runover by a truck. Will authorities take this responsibility ?? I don\'t think the people here are irregular on paying taxes either.

You can see the cattle excreta spread over and collections lying everywhere for long times without disposal. These get dispersed when it rains. There is a continuous smell of cow dung. There is a continuous flow of cowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s urine. a. Health hazards associated: Leptospirosis  bovine tuberculosis  brucellosis  etc. b. Fly population would increase and they may spread number of communicable diseases c. Breeding of mosquitoes-We cannot keep the door or windows open in the day or night due to the mosquitoes d. Since the road is already untarred and is a mud road it makes it more difficult to walk or drive a vehicle in the evening without stamping on the cowdung and urine since the cowdung and urine is all over the road. Suggestions: Why cant these cattle be kept in a confined area with proper hygienic conditions provided. They are supposed to be kept inside the ownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s residences and not on the road or in the conservancy.

Minor repairs to municipal property,Why BMTC bus conductors are not willing to give change at the moment when the commuters give money?..\nI board on to a bus from Ramamurthinagar to Marathahalli and I gave 100 rupees.So he had to give me 80 rupees as balance. The conductor didn\'t write any thing on the back of the ticket and I asked the balance twice on the way to marathahalli n he just went away as if he has no change with him. At last when i had to get down at my last stop  ie  Marathahalli I asked again n he pretends that he\'s very busy in writing some thing in his book. He gave me the balance only when i asked loudly second time as i was about to fight with him. And I saw a bunch of ten rupees notes with him.\nThey are fraudsters and trying to take the money by checking the travellers\' memory to ask the balance amount. In many cases the travellers may forget the balance as the city dwellers are busy and tensed with their job n life. So these conductors are taking advantage of it. \nMy suggestion to this problem is simple but to implement a machine by which it can print the ticket mentioning the place a commuter boarding n getting down. So the travellers and checkers can know exactly fro where to where a person is travelling n how much the charge too. And if some thing to be implemented in an advanced method  we can implement swipe cards in the buses. Some of the private buses in Kerala implemented it and successful too.\n\nSecond problem is that  what\'s the criteria use to calculate the bus fare?..\nIt\'s really unreasonable to givr more money for the short distances and less money for the long distances especially when BMTC has no proper services through routes and travellers are compelled to board on to different buse too. \nFro example  if I travel to domlur from Ramamurthi nagar  i have to board in to three buses but the distance is less than 11 kms.\nSo first i have tpay5 rupees to reach ITI gate n then 17 to Binnamangala and again 11 rupees to domlur. So 34 rupees to travel 11 kms. Is it reasonable?...\nThird problem is about the ratio of ordinary buses to the volvo buses.\nBMTC is compelling the majority of poor and middle class people to pay more by allocating more volvo buse in some routes by reducing the number of ordinary buses. This can be seen in marathahalli  silkboard n hebbal routes. And many of the buses are running empty too.\nOnce i travelled to airport in a volvo and i was the only one in the bus as a traveller to airport at night. \nAgain in some routes we can see that there will not be any buses for a long time ie  1 hour etc and we can see two or three buses are coming continuously. Except the first bus other buses will be running empty too. \nAnd finally all the effect of this mismanagement is on the shoulder of daily commuters by not willing to reduce the ticket charge even though the diesel price has come down considerably. This will create the city traffic also to a worst condition because all people will prefer to travel by their own vehicle. So it result in endless traffic trouble in Bangalore.\nIs it called as public transport for the benefit of public?..\nAnd who is benefiting out of this corrupted system?..,Minor repairs to municipal property,Drainage chokes and blockages,Person falling in Manhole

Our concern is how long this process goes on and when we will get the good road  although if BWSSB takes up the work they don\'t bother to complete the task and clear the road on time (Please find attached photo which is self explanatory).

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,We have high freq Volvo shuttles connecting IT corridors   from Central to East Blr (335e)  South to East (500c) and South to North (500d).

The number of times i\'ve entered my colony members\' homes at late evening or whenever a dog barked at me for no reason  is simply too high. I have stopped going out or returning in the evenings cause in the dark they blindly chase people. I also understood that there are men who drive way too fast inside the colony and drift sometimes  this scares all the dogs and as a result  they noe chase Every Single white coloured car. Know why? Because they somehow remember. I mean  even one or two stray dogs are manageable but here..we currently have minimum of 6 dogs at every turning. So they will come running even if one dog barks at a person or vehicle. I would really like to make an honest request to you  to please see to it that the colony is not dominated by dogs  to let the children play outside as they avoid doing so today because if the stray dogs. Its horrendous to walk on the roads seeing so many dogs keeping an eye on you. Its also terribly sad that that i have to slow down just so that the dofs dont misunderstand my urgency to catch my bus to college! I waste time in waiting for their fights to get over or for someone to come along so that i could walk with them. There seems to be no end in migrations of these dogs from one place to another.. So its a humble request and prioritized necessity that we get rid of these excess of stray dogs here  so that for once  i dont have to earn every dog\'s trust as i leave for the bus stop and can walk around my colony even in the evenings or early mornings. After all   neither are they happy nor the people.. And as we all know  too much is always too bad. Thank you!,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Sweeping of road

Unauthorised construction development,The whole country maybenefit from the SWACHH BHARAT call  but not Bangalore even though the Corporation is in the hands of the BJP.  I started the Swachh Bharat movement in our street and it worked very well  until we realised that the garbage had only shifted to adjustment places  because there is  no system to remove garbage from public places.    why can`t Bangalore learn from places like Chennai in handling garbage.There is a wrong system of collecting a fee by small time contractors.Smaller apartments  individual houses and way side shops  who do not want to give the the money through it on the road  and public places.Since the contractors do not get paid for collecting garage from public places and do  not gather them and Bangalore is the only city in our   country with garbage bins. It is all a politician-contractor nexus- Gaarbage Mafia.

Bad Patches,There are huge pot holes at both the sides of the bridge connecting Channasandra to Thirumalashetty halli on NH 207. These potholes were created due to heavy rains and heavy vehicle traffic. It is unattended since many months and this is creating huge traffic jams during peak hours as vehicles cannot go past this bridge quickly due to the potholes. If left unattended it might create permanent damage to the brige and there might be risk of bridge getting collapsed. Temporary solutions like mud filling are done but that is not at all a solution as the mud got dissolved in the rain.

Flooding during monsoon,"I had recently been to the koramangala police station to file an fir complain that I have lost my documents . The police man was not paying any attention to my complaint and he said in kannada - \""so what should I do if you have lost it?\"" I asked him to file an fir and give me an acknowledgement. he and another police woman was making fun of me and he even threatened me of not giving. later I started to cry when they where making fun of me and other police men from the same branch gathered and started to ask me irrelevant questions like - \""what my father was doing?  if I was married?  what time I get back home?\"" Instead of asking where and how I lost it and helping me. finally when I started to cry the police inspector filed the fir and gave it to me after 3 hours 25 mins. Is this how Bangalore police men behave to a woman who wanted some help? Is this why our parents tell us that if we have any problem we have to inform the police? when the police officers just wanted to have fun. Now I understand when rape victims go to the police station how these police men behave with those innocent women.

The road in front of the BBMP office and Shasakara Bhavana has designated places for Two Wheeler parking but most of the day  Cars are parked in no-parking zones only thereby eating up the free space in the road for smooth movement of traffic.\n\nI request the BTP (High Grounds Traffic Police Station) to take necessary action.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Traffic cops are mute spectators and sometimes even enjoy an odd laugh looking at the situation of an ongoing harassment situation like this. I have also experienced intolerable vulgur gestures where they try to lick the person by tongue or even spit on the motorbike. No one wants this. Why do the traffic cops not disperse these maniacs with such anti social behavior? I think it\'s only a matter of time before our patience boils out and we ourselves start handling such perverts who misbehave in public (especially with our fellow female co-citizens),Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Minor repairs to municipal property

Drainage chokes and blockages,Every year the Sewage line on the road gets clogged and begins to overflow. The pipes are old and the flow is against the gravity  due to which the sewage is back flowing and hence foul smell emanates from the sewage lines inside the houses.

Sweeping of road,Most vehicles  especially autos  2 wheelers   taxis etc cut into the next lane all of a sudden without any signal  cut across roads  start driving slowly in front of vehicles after changing lanes  speak on mobile phones(all vehicles)  drive with blinding high beam headlights etc. Traffic police MUST penalise drivers severely and more CONSISTENTLY through the day. Very few locations do this between 10-1 and maybe 6-7. It\'s a rare sight in namma Bengaluru. Traffic flow is smoother and will reduce accidents  if you just fine drivers for lane cutting violation alone. Thank you.

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,I take an auto everyday from Domlur bridge to EGL main entrance. Everyday I face this problem of Auto drivers demanding unjustified amounts. The distance is just about 1 km and in the last 3 months only one auto driver agreed to go this distance on meter rate. Everyone else demands from 40-60 Rs. Why do they even have a meter in their autos if the dont have to use it. They come up with this baseless argument that they need to take a U turn and come back. How is that justified ? Even I have to walk inside EGL for 1km to reach my workplace. Am i taking money from my company for that ? The main reason why auto drivers have these demands are because people in Bangalore dont think about the money they spent on auto rides. It is we who have spoil their habits. Even though it is Rs 20 only...by the end of the year it all mounts up to atleast 5200/- extra that I pay to auto drivers. Why should we pay this? Why aren\'t there any rules for Auto drivers in Bangalore? Domlur is such an important junction. There should be a police inspector there or atleast prepaid auto stand.

Bad Patches,I have recently moved to Bovi Colony Main Road  opp. turahalli mini forest.  From the days well before I have started constructing my house  garbage like building materials  wastes are being dumped everyday on either side of this road.  Upon asking they are saying its done as per BBMP and they will level it.  I wonder why BBMP would ask to dump building waste on rain water drain  eventually I got to know that these are being done illegally by tractor owners of vicinity.  If someone questions them they say BBMP  if ladies in our household questions them they stare at them in such a way that that they never would ever dare to come out if tractor seen around.  The constant dumping has caused blockage of rain water drainage on both sides of road.  If it rains heavily all the road water enters our home and causes huge problem to clean them.  Please look into the matter and stop all building waste materials  building materials are being dumped on road side.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Sweeping of road

Since the overhead bridge is being constructed on the other side  all vehicles from KR Puram to Hoody use this road. The road has giant pot holes  without tar and only gravel and slush mud on the road causing huge discomfort to the commuters. It has been in this condition for a year now and all complaints so far have only fallen on deaf ears. My previous complaint is still pending and unattended by the BBMP quoting incorrect address. I have clearly mentioned in this complaint that this road houses the SJR Eternity and Kristal Citrine apartments and connect to the main Kodigehalli road.

Bad Patches,Dear Sir \nI am a daily commuter in the Outer ring road and I travel from Hebbal to Goraguntepalya. daily  I see many traffic violations across the ring road by commuters and the major violoations happens in two places. \n\n1. DeviNagar bus stop after the Big baazar flyover. ( Map location with marking attached)\nHere motorists coming from Devi nagar will cross the road and ride in the opposite direction to us who are coming from big bazaar flyover. The will come in that way for 200- 300 meters to cross the railway track to go to Lottegollahalli or Nagashettihalli. If some one questions them they give a careless look and go away. \nOnce an auto came towards a bus by crossing the road in the opposite direction. He escaped the bus but hit an old couple in a two wheeler who are behind the bus. The old lady got injury to her hand. When questioned the auto driver was answered rude to the old man. When I interviened and asked why did you come in wrong direction he answered \'No..this is the right direction.. i will come in this way only\' I have asked him why don\'t you go little further and take a U turn under the flyover and he replied \'who will go in that way..you want me go that far..no I will go in this way only and this is how I ride\'\nThis is just an example. Not only two wheelers and autos but also cars  mini vans are also go in the same way. I see many parents with their kids coming in that wrong route. I wonder where are the traffic cops. I never see any one on any day but I see at least one minor accident every week.\n\n2. Near Muthyalanagar Bus stop  Gokula Extension  opposite to HP petrol bunk.\n\nHere also  Motorists who comes from MS Ramaiah road and connect ORR at BEL circle near under bridge. From there  to go to Pipeline road one must go little ahead and take U turn near Muthyalanagar bust stop near Petrol Bunk but motorist will cross the road (There is no divider there) and come in the opposite direction. Even school buses  vans  Cars comes in the same route.\nWhen I questioned them they say \'houdu idu wrong route..nanu hige barthini...ninag yakke..hogappa\' (Yes..I know it is a wrong route  but I will come in this way only..why do you bother..go away)\nI see traffic cops in this junction once in a month and stopping them and charging fine  but being a daily menace I don\'t this is not the solution.\n\nI request the traffic cops to close the divider in the above two places with barricade so that every one take a U turn and go.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Minor repairs to municipal property

Bad Patches,Hello     My name is Biplab and i am living in Ayyappa Nagar  SM Road  Jallahalli West  Bangalore - 560015.    The roads in Ayyappa Nagar are in very pathetic condition. Many times road construction people came and did temporary repair but it never lasts for more than one week. It becomes a big mess in rain for both vehicles and pedestrians. Day by day the condition is becoming more worst. There are so many potholes and the road is in very bad condition.      Not only this  there is no proper garbage keeping facility also. As a result  you can see garbage thrown here and there on the road and outside houses. No doubt that BBMP people are doing there work efficiently  every morning people comes to take the garbage but till evening the roads becomes full of garbages. There are concrete chairs to the road sides but we can not sit there because of the garbages thrown on the road and can't even walk properly on the street.     So  i hearty request you to please do something and please give some solution for this. Please reconstruct the road properly and please place garbage containers outside every street.

Removal of rank regulation on roads,Hi  t is common everyday on 3rd Main  8th cross road at junction on HSR 14 main cross road to see Cows  Buffalo  ox getting attracted to the garbage and roam in this road including Jakkasandra village roads. These are animals which are to be taken care of by owners or municipality. The animals feed on garbage and shit around all places. Sometimes they enter house compounds to take shelter from rains. When they are not well after feeding on garbage they just fall down and they would lie there till it recovers or die. some times these big animals fight among themselves and damage the property  plants and vehicles around also injure people and children. These animals pose big danger in the vicinity. Request officials concerned to look into the issue and provide relief to residents of Jakkasandra and Venkatapura. Note: The problem is due the garbage dumping  may be if garbage is cleared they animals may not be here. .But Municipality has to give them food at different place.

Next to my house there are 3 vacant sites (Nos. 7  8 and 9) which have become a major dumping ground now. The site owners are very irresponsible to leave their property in such a situation and letting the neighbours face the embarrassment of living with garbage all around. I have been trying hard to get the phone numbers of the site owners but to no avail. If I get the numbers  I would want to them to hire a JCB and get the sites cleaned. They truly are irresponsible citizens. Hence  I am requesting BBMP to kindly help in clearing the garbage from the sites. This is not the first time I am complaining to BBMP  but the fourth time. The BBMP workers bury the garbage which is dangerous. When I asked why they are burying  they say no place to dump. Even after that  some irresponsible citizens still keep throwing the garbage there  a bunch of senseless people. I would also request BBMP to please find the contact numbers of these site owners from their records and give them a stern warning.\nThank You \nA concerned and a worried neighbour,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage lorry not reported for service

Garbage not lifted from house gully,Hi  Garbage is thrown on side of the road next to Shell petrol pump on Basavanagar main Road. 560037. People going to work  maids etc  just throw the garbage here and move on. Garbage van comes in the morning to clear it  but within few hrs again its full. Its so unhygienic. I think people throw garbage here because the door to door collection of it is very poor. If you walk on this road  you will notice garbage dumped at every few yards. Request BBMP to resolve this permanently please and give residents a more healthy environment. \nThanks..,Garbage not lifted from house gully,Garbage not lifted from co-authorised collection point,Collection point not attended properly
Drainage chokes and blockages,After repeated complaints; garbage still remains unattended and heaping. People around the vicinity have no common sense   lack civic sense and dump garbage at a blink of an eye. BBMP needs to penalise the people who dump and stop this as a act of dumping at this corner. The stench from garbage is horrible - why are we so insensitive to others. As the new corporator is being voted in (which i shall also participate in) we require an immediate solution to this - the solution being barricading of this area to avoid garbage dumping - putting up a penalty board  making the footpath walkable. Catch the people who dump by seizing their aadhaar card or so. It is simply ironic as BBMP PEOPLE ALSO DUMP ALL THE GARBAGE here as seen in the photos from their auto. They dump everything from mattresses to Water closets. The BBMP workers also take the debris & muck from other places & fill it on the road as seen in the image again. Mind you even the road is not motorable - it is in a pathetic conditions with certain areas caving in also. Request all citizens of the locality to stand up  and create a commmunity sense and not dump garbage - which applies especially to the BBMP. Lets do one thing why not dump garbage in front of ministers office - will they keep quiet about it??? I keep getting a comment from Henry Robert stating to close the complaint. How can i close it when it is not resolved???,Drainage chokes and blockages,Collection point not attended properly,Silt to be lifted on road
Mosquito nuisance,There are so many 401 range buses through the above mentioned routes connecting Yelahanka to other areas via Yeshwanthpur. However  it is all through a single route (except the deviation to Vidyaranyapura and MS Palya). It would be so helpful if some buses are connected to Hebbal via BEL circle. Many professionals work in companies located all through Outer Ring Road. If one has to reach Marathahalli from Doddabettahalli  he has to catch one bus to BEL circle  then another to Hebbal and take another bus from there. It is a long journey and almost an hour is wasted in reaching Hebbal itself. It takes no more than 15 minutes in bike through the GKVK road. But there are no proper parking facilities in Hebbal to take that option. So we have to rely on BMTC services. I hope the concerned authorities find a solution for this.,Mosquito nuisance,Rat nuisance,Fogging
Bad Patches,Dear Sir \n\nGovernment spent lakhs of rupees in remodeling the pavements of Dr. Rajkumar Road ( Stretch between Star Bazaar Signal to Navrang signal. They have clearly made space for parking cars and two wheeler on one side from the Star Bazaar to Navrang ( Opp . Suguna Hospital side ). Now the problem is the Police have marked alternate parking days in this stretch. There is no logic behind this because the other side do not have space for parking vehicles and they have to be parked in the road. This will lead to congestion on Tuesdays   Thursdays and Saturdays from Navrang to Star Bazaar side of Dr.Rajkumar Road.I request your team to take up the issue with higher authorities and resolve the same so that we can park our vehicles at the bays provided by the Government and not on the road,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,The enterance/exit to the newly constructed railway underpass at kasturinagar II phase near purvanka midtown  beniganahalli lake which was expected to be a huge relief for the traffic pile up on beniganahalli bridge has itself become a problem. \nThe mouth of the underpass on FCI godown rd side becomes 1 lane from 2 lanes causing a massive bottleneck and stops traffic movement completely during peak hours.\n\nthe issue is due to diversion of the road to the side area which has made this expensive underpass useless defeating the purpose of its construction.\none solution will be to make the ingress and egress lanes at different grades. i.e.  exit lane is lower in height and entry lane is at a higher height giving access both to the underpass as well as the side area.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Now people have stopped walking there and the place is full of stray dogs. \n\nGarbage is one issue and the other problem is people have started throwing chicken carcass.\n\nKindly take action at the earliest.\n\nThanks \nRaj Gowda,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Sweeping of road

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,We have empty plot and open land next to Bellandur Lake  next to our community Mantri Espana in Kariyama Agara  Bellandur near Sakra World Hospital. The open land is taken by rag pickers/slum dwellers. New slums are coming up at fast pace. Our community is surrounded with open defecation  mixed garbage dumped daily and construction debris continuous flow. All this open area is becoming landfill and  slum dwellers colony. Both are growing at fast pace. All slum dwellers defecate in open  pick up all garbage from nearby shops. Sell the scraps that they can and rest of waste is dumped in open mixed with wet waste  coconuts and construction debris. Then there is garbage burning that keeps happening on and off. Construction debris dumping has been reported to BBMP many times along with trailer/tractor numbers but no action has been taken so far. Continuous flow of debris trucks throughout the night cause disturbance. Apart from causing visual distress  these surrounding are becoming health hazard to the community who is following all solid waste management practices on premises including segregation  wet waste composting. The view of cows feeding through mixed waste and eating plastic  stray dogs on garbage piles and small slum dwellers children looking for valuable waste has become a daily sight.We are swamped with flies in our houses and can't open windows. Dumped coconuts are accumulating rain water and becoming breeding grounds for dengue mosquito. Please advise what should be next course of action to  --- get area clean of garbage piles   ---- Stop dumping of garbage --- stop construction debris dumping that is coming from construction at RMZ Ecoworld and other big names ---- Get notice to owner of private land for negligence of his property that is resulting in becoming health hazard for society.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Trade without License,Hawkers

There are many more which are not even reported. Many of these can be avoided with lane driving. Don\'t you think so?\nNot following Lane Driving is also one of the main reasons of this crazy bad traffic in Bangalore.\nWhy there are no awareness campaigns or publicity drives by the government or a non governmental body?

All surrounding roads in JP Nagar 1st Phase have been dug up but have not been repaired to get to position of how it was before digging.

Bad Patches,"The Devarabesanahalli ""mud road"" that leads commuters from Yemlur side via the Bellandur Lake road to Kariyamanna Agaraha  is a pot holes ridden and barely qualifies to be addressed as a ""road"".    All states and manners of vehicles  from huge goods carriers to fancy imported cars  ply on this road at their own risk.    Monsoon is going to make matters worse. When it rains  it renders this route near unusable  but people still take a chance to avoid the traffic jammed main roads.    Forget about maintenance  we need proper compaction  gravel  and asphalting first.    Why do we need this road built and maintained?    - Keeps a huge amount of traffic off the already choking HAL Airport Road  Marathahalli main road  and the Outer Ring Road.     - Saves commuters a lot of time and agony when plying through the clogged main roads.     - Gives relatively easier passage to reach big establishments such as the Mantri building that houses Flipkart and JDA  Sobha apartments  Sakra hospital  and Bangalore Central  to name just a few.    If you look at the Google Earth screenshot attached  the irony is  that it appears as a legit road on the map  but in reality  doesn't even qualify as a road.    There are more apartment complexes and huge building under construction off the Bellandur lake and this mud road  so everyone can foresee the traffic situation worsening soon.    Appeal to BBMP (and all concerned departments) to take this up on priority and build the road at the earliest.",Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,This is a familiar sight for all commuting on the Bellandur lake road via Yemlur - to be greeted by foul smelling  toxic  frothing sewage.     If it is a windy day  expect to see the froth flying all over  landing on the windshields  like (toxic) snow! Even our curriculum's ensure that our children learn in schools about - H2S  Ammonia  Methane  Monoxides and more toxic or flammable gases - resulting from untreated sewage.    The froth in Yemlur caught fire recently. Citizens expect the authorities to act swiftly enough to prevent a bigger fire or bio-hazard that's clearly waiting to happen.    Why are we living with the lack of basic infrastructure and safety in a tier-1 city like Bangalore?    We must begin with addressing this to be able to save our lakes and underground water resources.    1. Why is this happening?  2. Who are the culprits - local residential complexes without STPs? Industries?   3. Isn't releasing toxic  untreated sewage unlawful?  4. What is the penalty? Are they being levied on defaulters?

Bad Patches,Kindly refer my complaint no. W01390C117550. The 2nd Main road at New Tharagupet  right opposite the Central Police Station  adjacent to Minto Eye Hospital and Madhuvan Lodge is not at all motor able because of the bad condition of the road. Several complaints to repair the said road have not been addressed by the BBMP authorities. Are these officers not answerable to their superiors or is it a nexus in the BBMP?\nPart of the road is always covered by the heavy commercial vehicles parked in the no parking zone (in three parallel rows) making the life of the common man miserable. The Central Police Station boasts a huge hoarding inspiring the citizens of Bangalore city to report traffic offences through the PUBLIC EYE application for Android & Apple phones is right opposite to this road. It is beyond my understanding as to why the officers at the Central Police Station do not act on these offenders who are creating this nuisance right opposite to their office.\nThese websites like ichangemy city  public eye & bbmp.sahaya.in are all an eye wash and none of the officers want to do their jobs. No wonder the infrastructure is crumbling and the days are not far when the prestigious companies of Bangalore would say goodbye and move on to Pune  Hyderabad and parts of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh where the leadership is responsive to these issues.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Major repairs to municipal property

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,The footpath between 9th cross and Trinity Diagnostic center in JP Nagar 2nd phase  KSRTC Layout  (near 4th Main) is being used as Garbage dumping place for near by residents. And since the footpath is in bad condition and used as garbage bin  lots of public (passers by  auto drivers  cab drivers  and pedestrians) and near by slum dwellers are using the place as public toilet. The footpath is unusable and since many people urinate as well as used it as toilet  the place stinks and we are scared of spread of diseases. It is highly necessary to not only clean and pay a new footpath but also beautify that place so that people don\'t simply continue using that place as toilet. And also there is necessity of Free to use public toilets close by and increase awareness among slum dwellers to use toilets inside their homes instead of roads as its dangerous for people living close by and also to them. The place is becoming so badly unusable because of no authority taking action on this. Not just cleaning the place but keeping it well lit and taking steps that make people embarrass to use the place as toilet is needed.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages,Unauthorised construction development

Bad Patches,The Old Madras Road was dug up along the left side while going from Suranjandas Road signal towards KR Puram about an year ago for laying some pipe line . After the pipe line was laid the dug up portion was refilled with loose mud and left without topping up with tar for more than a year now. There is no road at all at the left side where the road takes a left turn towards Biayyappanahalli Metro Station .Same is the case while taking a right turn while coming from the Metro Station into the Old Madras Road. While giving contracts for digging up the road for laying electrical or water or sewarage pipe lines are the contractors not required to restore the road to the original condition by properly refilling the dug up portion  hardening it and then topping it with tar immediately after the work of laying the pipe line is over?

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,"Dear Sir \nPlease go through the mail chain below to know the gravity of the situation and take immediate corrective action against DLF and JLL Property Managements firms. Repeated requests for resolution (mail chain below) have gone unheard by DLF/JLL management and it\'s just a matter of time before a major mishap happens and BBMP will have to answer!\nDear Ms Shikha\n\nThis is a really serious matter and a matter of life and death. Solicit your prompt attention in this regard. It is a sensible demand that any expense towards repairing the lift for toruble free operation should be covered under manufacturer warranty. In case manufacturer warranty is over  DSHPL should bear the cost on its head and not pass it on to the Association via JLL.\n\nJust in case you have conflicting thoughts  it is important to note Section 7.3 and 7.4 of Karnataka Ownership of Flats Act  1972.\n\nhttp://dpal.kar.nic.in/16 of 1973 (E).pdf\n\nIt is also important to not the difference between \""operational issues\"" vs \""defect\"".\n\nAny product comes with a warranty for certain period. Warranty is to assure that the product would function precisely the way it is expected to be under prescribed conditions.

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,It is a pain to tackle autorickshaw drivers with their constant demands to pay more than what the amount comes by meter. For eg.  if a minimum fare is Rs. 25 now  they are not willing to go within 1.5kms if the amount if not Rs. 30 to Rs. 40. Or  if the fare comes out to be Rs. 80 at 9pm in the evening  they demand for Rs. 100  or even 1.5 to 2 times the fare  for late night charges  even if the night charges are applicable only post 10pm. 80% of the autorickshaw drivers I request to take me to a certain location say an outright no  if I am adamant to tell them that I\'ll be paying only by the meter. In Mumbai  this would never be the case with autos nor taxis  as the rules are quite strict. Even in Delhi in recent times  the autorickshaws are running on meter  and not overcharging as there is always a threat to them if we complain on the direct helpline no. However  in Bangalore  many of us aren\'t even aware of such an option to lodge a complaint against autorickshaw drivers who don\'t run by the meter. Is there a possibility that they cant say no to us if we request them to run by meter  and take us to any specified location  and only pay the right fare amount. Kindly advice as to how this issue can be resolved.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Sir / Madam \n\nI would like to bring to your notice the condition of the median section on Outer Ring Road  right opposite to Rainbow Children Hospital (Doddenakundi).  Due to poor construction quality  this particular median section has been damaged.  With each passing day  the median gap has widened so much that 2-wheeler commuters are using it as a regular U-turn.  Please refer to the picture attached for your reference.  \n\nNot only does this pose a huge safety issue for speeding vehicles on the Outer Ring Road coming in from both KR Puram as well as Marathahalli  but it is also a blatant violation of traffic rules.  I myself have been in a situation where I\'ve had to brake suddenly to \'give way\' to the 2-wheelers who think it\'s ok to use this broken median as a legal U-turn.  \n\nPlease be informed that I have counted at least 6 such places on the Outer Ring Road  right from Doddenakundi till Bellandur where such broken medians have been intentionally damaged so that 2-wheelers can use it.  \n\nI would request the municipal authorities to take action immediately  before it causes serious risk to the commuters on this road.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain",Hawkers

Bad Patches,Rains in Bangalore are not a new thing. The foot paths in Whitefield near ITPL to hoodi circle are completely unusable during the rains. They get filled with water  are used as parking and full of wide holes with thick long iron pipes scattered all over the place. The traffic congestion causes these muddy footpaths to be used as side roads. This is on both sides of the road.    The pedestrians have to eventually walk on the road making it unsafe for them and susceptible to mud splashes by vehicles. So many people living nearby prefer to drive to offices just a km away than walking because the walk is so dirty and dangerous.  There are no signals for pedestrians on the crossing and they just have to run half the road when traffic on that half stops moving. They crowd on the dividers in between moving traffic on either side. No zebra crossing. Running across whenever they get their break even if the traffic signal is green. This is just sad. This adds to the traffic problems in Whitefield.    The restaurant Punjabi by Nature laid down stones on the footpath in front of it's own building for their aesthetics but they now use the public footpath as their private parking. The pedestrians are often forced to the road on that patch now. This is right in front of the crossing under the nose of the traffic cops.    Owing to the IT parks nearby I have seen a lot of foreigners/expats walking on these footpaths. I wonder every time what image they would be taking back home of our country. Many of them come on business trips no longer than a few days. This is all they get to see. Today I saw a group of foreigners struggling to walk on the footpath. Honked by bikes trying to bypass traffic and splashing mud on pedestrians. From their attire you could guess they were here on a business trip. From their expression I wondered if they were sad they wore that business suit or maybe that it rained or they regretted traveling to India altogether.    It's unfathomable how such a horrible condition would be allowed to reach by the Government when:    1. This place is home to more than half a dozen International Tech Parks.  2. It generates a huge amount of revenue and money inflow into the nation.  3. The residents  mostly working in IT and related firms nearby  pay taxes proportion to their salaries which relatively is high.  4. This problem is persistent since many YEARS. Since this place's inception there was never a footpath. An unpaved mudpile on the sides of the road is being used to walk by pedestrians.   5. It has caused so many accidents. Pedestrians walking on the road sides are hit by moving volvos and bikes trying to squeeze their way. Bikes on the footpaths honk on slow walking pedestrians.  6. It has a huge potential to influence the image of the country.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1LiCkof1cs  This video of the stretch from Hope farm to Hoodi shot before the rains shows the pathetic state of this whole matter. Wonder how horrible it is to walk or drive on this path during the rains!    The road and footpath connecting to ITPL from hope farm is in an appalling state. They have been dug up and left covered unusable by pedestrians and the muddy in the holes on the roads makes it impossible to walk on the road as well. The effective width of the road has shrunk and it causes traffic problems.    I went through ICMC and found that this stretch of road had tons of complaints. I hope this matter would be considered of high importance since it's affecting a lot of citizens.    http://www.ichangemycity.com/complaints/footpath-stretch-laden-with-huge-drainage-pipes-for-months-together-now    http://www.ichangemycity.com/bangalore/complaints/hopeform-to-kr-puram-main-road-digged-and-not-repaired    http://www.ichangemycity.com/bangalore/complaints/entire-whitefield-road-has-become-12-lane    http://www.ichangemycity.com/bangalore/complaints/daily-traffic-jam-at-hope-farm-junction-with-a-possible-solution,Bad Patches,Odour  foul smell  from drains,Drainage chokes and blockages

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,A couple of months ago a \'uniformed\' gang of workers started digging roads in R T Nagar. We were told that they have been \'awarded\' the contract by the BWSSB to dig roads to lay new pipe lines. We were pleasantly surprised to see a gang of L&T workers doing their job  they looked like thorough professionals. It turned out to be a mirage. The dug holes they had filled turned out to be death traps  especially after the unusual rains unleashed their fury. They also cut the roads to connect pipes to respective homes close to the existing water metres. They assured all that they would fill the holes and close them with cement and bring them to their original condition. It was a shock to see the gang \'filling and cementing\' the holes! Job done  they all vanished and the cemented portions have given way. This from a reputed firm like L&T!!\n\nWe always criticise the PWD department for shoddy work. At least one private agency has proved that it is no different. It would be nice for some agency to take a tour in R T Nagar and take stock of the condition they have created. \n\nS D Chakravarthy,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Person falling in Manhole,This is about the prepaid taxi services provided by the Bangalore and airport taxi drivers union (R) approved by Government of Karnataka at the Cantonment railway station. When autos are a bit stremlined here  taxis are not. The Taxis are in horrible conditions most of them the Omni vans  Non AC. It is only after you go near the taxi allotted you know what you are in for. The prepaid charges costed me 380 rupees plus 20 rupees as service charges. After coming home I checked on the web. For a distance of 12 kms it it around 160 rupees. What is this union about. The members all seem to birds of the same feather. How can Government of Karnataka register and permit such unfair charges for lousy vehicles. This has to be taken up by some other outside agency for review for an unbiased purview. Getting the right services and facilities for the money we pay is a citizen\'s right. But I reinsist it has to be taken up by an outside agency  otherwise I don\'t expect justice. No opening kilometers  no closing. No AC  not a proper car but a repaired omni vehicle. Ironically all the vehicles were in similar condition. No chart display of the kind of vehicle allottted or the fares (random- muh bola daam!) where are we living?The computer at the counter also was disfunctional. Meru rates are half what has been charged. What is the pupose of this counter? To help whom? Definitely not the passengers. I am going to fight this case in multi forums  including consumer forums.

Bad Patches,When you enter Devarabisanahalli from outer ring road  through the entrance arch next to Grand Adigas  you will see an entirely different world that is in total contrast to what you see outside the arch.\nThe roads are fully damaged with narrow stretches and no footpath. They have not seen tar for probably more than 6-7 years.\nBeing home to lot of daily wage  low income group people the roads are extremely crowded. People find it hard to walk when vehicles come behind / front as one has to stop to give way to others. The rainy season makes it more worse for people walking on streets. Adding to these  there is lot of filth  garbage dumped on roadside by small time shops  eating joints  chicken/mutton/fish shops. You can tell there can\'t be any other place worse than this. \nWith number of high rise buildings  crowded residential colonies increasing  this area is exploding day by day. \nThere is total negligence by local leaders. They have failed miserably in getting basic amenities for the people living in the village. The drinking water problem has been a decade old issue which has not been addressed. Though there is water supply on the ring road  the leaders were not able to get the supply to the village people. \nLiving here has been a hell like experience and it is hard to believe this is part of the so called garden city.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Minor repairs to municipal property

In spite of so many complaints in past and BBMP closing the complaints as resolved and in spite of High Court passing the order to clear the footpath of all encroachers they remain encorached. Pedestrians are forced to walk on the roads and face the rash driving of our citizens.    When we ask encroachers to remove the obstacle they get down to fight and tell us to mind our business. Because of inefficiency of BBMP citizens are suffering and that too inspite of paying heavy taxes to the government. There is no accountability. People are fearless of any laws they do as they wish there is no one governing these people. The only few who take rules  laws and regulation seriously always suffer under the non followers. Government does nothing to safeguard the citizens against these errant encroachers.    I request BBMP to clear all encroachment on this road.

How long do you take to finish a small road? 3 years? In addition  The road at Nallurhalli was dug up completely to lay sewer lines. When is this stretch going to be relaid?\n\nRequests: \n1) When you lay a road  please cut the old road tar and and relay with new tar. If you just paste a layer on the top  it is not going to stick to the layer underneath and not going to last for more than a couple of years. In addition  use gravel and clay and press them with road rollers before laying tar.\n2) Please finish the road work with a month from starting. You cannot take an year to finish a road causing inconvenience to commuters all the time.\n3) Before laying a road think in advance whether any sewer lines  cables need to be laid and do so before laying a road  not afterwards.\n4) When you dig up a road relay it with in month.\n\nPlease let us know when you are planning on repairing/finishing the Borewell road. \nWho ever is responsible for these roads is doing the worst job possible.,Bad Patches,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Person falling in Manhole

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Despite of all the BMTC Buses plying from Madiwala-market(1-Way) towards Silk board  stops and boards the passengers in the market road(bus stop)  still some educated & ignorant lazy-passengers continue standing in the junction(madiwala traffic police station corner) ahead of the destined bus stop and choke the traffic here Unnecessarily!..    What is shocking and pathetic is to see that There is a big banner installed here in the junction (with Picure sign)instructing the passengers not to board the 'bus' at this spot  and choke the junction. However the shameless Rowdy BMTC Driver's ignore and stop here for these shameless passengers to board at the junction  ignoring the honks of other vehicles and buses awaiting behind to take the left turn towards Silk board.  This creates traffic congestion at the junction  by preventing vehicles to take a free left-turn.    It is my kind request that the concerned traffic dept. and officialâ€™s posted here should:  (a) Not allow passengerâ€™s to stand below the said Banner and still disobey the rules  set.  (b) Not allow the BMTC buses to stop at the junction even for few seconds unnecessarily &  (c) Most importantly the automatic doorâ€™s (Back & Front) of these buses should be closed by the Driver of the BMTC Bus - once the passengers have boarded it at the bus stop  and â€˜door-closedâ€™ before approaching the â€˜dreaded junctionâ€™  Else these smart-educated-lazy-shameless-passengers(mostly Young Men and Women) pretend to be a â€œpedestrianâ€ right below the flex sign board and on seeing the BMTC bus door open and its slowing down while taking the left turn  get off the footpath and stop the bus at this junction and board it : choking the signal!!.

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,I\'m a resident of Shivanna layout  Halage Vaderahalli- Rajarajeshwari Nagar. There are 10-11 stray dogs in our locality that have been causing a menace. Their nuisance has increased in the recent days. Every night  a group of them involve in a fight with each other  bark and haul loudly till the dawn. This keeps the residents up all night. They are fond of scattering the garbage all over the streets from somewhere. I am afraid if their population is left unchecked  then there might be complaints of dog bites as well. We don\'t want the dogs to be culled or harmed but we suggest that they can be evacuated from the area  sterilized and sheltered elsewhere. It is a humble request to the BBMP to kindly have a look into this issue and resolve the same.,Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Hawkers,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Here the outer ring road and service road merges  before Milan Marbles and Granite\'s on the service road. Nearly 100 meters there is no road divider separation between outer ring road and service road  this is very dangerous. Because vehicles coming from both ring road and service road merges in V-shape at high speed. And also there is no road humps in both service road and ring road to control speed of vehicles. \nSecond  we have to cross dangerous high speed ring road to catch the bus  if we have to travel towards opposite direction. We request to put big scientific hump on both outer-ring road and service road and also sky walk  where ever bus stop on entire stretch of the ring road.\nSame fate on other side of the ring road  near ASR convention hall. There also speedily vehicle merges in V-shape speedily. There also put big scientific hump in both ring road and service road and increase the road divider between ring road and service on the junctions.\nThis pro-active steps will avoid the incidents which happened last day(26-FEB-2015) in ring road  near hebbal.\n\nI have posted above in Facebook to Bangalore Traffic Police  but I am yet to get a reply.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Major repairs to municipal property

Bad Patches,The stretch between Outer Ring Road  Bhadrappa Layout and Kodigehalli Ganesha Temple is one of the worst roads in Bangalore. With potholes dotting the entire stretch  accompanied by mud and drainage work that has been ongoing for over 3 years this also happens to be one of the most neglected areas despite coming within BBMP/BDA limits. With UID all India data centre and numerous apartments existing/coming up  the traffic on this road is bound to get worse unless the concerned authorities wake up and make it a proper road. This road is expected to undergo road widening to make it a 60-80\' wide; work started last month but stopped after a court ordered to stay the work. This is an extremely dangerous road for commuters of all age and sex  especially for elderly people  pregnant women and kids with heavy vehicles spamming the little road.

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,Dear Sir/Madam  I  as a Resident of Dodda Banaswadi area  Bangalore take the privilege of bringing to your kind attention to the stray dog menace in the locality of Dodda Banaswadi (surrounding to Anjaneya Temple). For the last four months the number of stray dogs in the locality have increased manifold and the people living in this area have been terror-striken by such dogs. It is also most obnoxious and disturbing when these stray dogs start barking in chorus continuing for prolonged time at all the nights robbing of slumber of the people. It is now of paramount necessity to get rid of these dogs immediately from this locality so that the residents living in this area can heave a sigh of relief. Looking to the gravity of the situation I would request your good-self to take immediate remedial measures to rid this area from the obnoxious menace. Your immediate action in the matter will be highly appreciated. Thanking you  Yours faithfully.

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,World class cities like Dubai and big western metropolitan cities use underground electricity distribution system. This should be done in Bangalore too. Underground electricity cables  poles  telephone wires and transformers would help prevent the damage caused due to environmental factors like rain and heavy winds which cause power cuts and disconnection of telephone lines. Moreover  telephone and electricity poles and transformers are also an obstruction to pedestrians on the footpaths. If these are put underground then we\'ll have spacious and wider footpaths. Often we hear cases of people getting electrocuted due to cables falling or transformers. A transformer bursting can also be dangerous for people. If these are put underground it will also improve public safety. Tangled wires also make the city skyline look congested. If these are underground the skyline would look much beautiful.

As they had not made grooves in the road first and cleaning it before applying a generous layer of bitumen  and then applying the mixture of crushed stone and again good amount of bitumen  whatever job done is unlikely to remain in place after even a small rain.

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Dear BBMP Colleagues \n\nI am Archana Prasad working as S/W Engineer at SAP labs. \nI got your mail ID from BBMP site and i have a thought to improve traffic Condition at Graphite Signal which i have been taking since 4 years.\n\nLocation: Graphite India Signal Itpl Main Road  Brookefield  Bangalore - 560037 \nWard # 85\n\nIn 3 years i see there is much increase in Traffic on this road.\nThere is huge Traffic at Graphite Signal all the time on all the weekdays.\nThere are more than 50 IT companies in the ITPL Main road  but there is only one road(no alternate way)\n\nAs you can see in the screen shot attached  Graphite signal is the place which takes min 20 mins to cross. This is the point where traffic from K.R.Puram  Videhi and Marathalli meets.\nIf you see most of the companies are on the Right of the Kundalahalli lake.\nBut to reach there  all company buses or 2 wheelers or 4 wheelers need to cross Graphite Signal. Though there are many traffic police men to manage traffic  because of the huge number of vehicles taking Graphite signal to reach offices it really takes long time at the signal. Traffic will increase day by day because of new constructions and new Offices in this area. \nThe only way to manage traffic is to have alternate way to reach Videhi.\n\n1 km road near Kundalahalli Lake can surely reduce 1/3 traffic at Graphite.\nAlready there is kaccha road near lake which is taken by few ppl who are aware of it.\nLeft road is presently blocked by Villagers whos are simply staying there for free and polluting the lake and surroundings.\n\nMy request to you is to have a view on this plan. \nThis road would surely be an advantage to all IT company employees and also to Traffic police in managing traffic.\n\nAlso I have raised several compains(134424  137687 n 139222) for potholes and bad Road at Graphite signal. But no action is taken. Please engage respective authorities look in to the complains.\n\nThanks in advance and hoping for the best :)\n\nRegards \nArchana,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Drainage chokes and blockages,Bad Patches

Bad Patches,The Joint Commissioner  BBMP Mahadevapura Zone \n\nWe  the residents of GR-ECC Road  and Agrahara-ECC Road  along with users of the two roads  have been put to extreme hardship due to the indiscriminate digging activities by multiple agencies.\n\nThe 2-km street from Cheshire Home to GR Tech Park via Ecumenical Christian Centre (ECC) and The Deens Academy has not been repaired for many years. In the last two months  digging by BWSSB for pipeline  and by telecom companies for OFC  has ruined the roads. During digging operations  there was no signboard displaying the contractorâ€™s name  no barricade or ribbon to warn pedestrians  cyclists  or motorists. Many vehicles have got stuck in these pits. A major mishap may happen. We see chaos every morning  worsened by the recent damage.\nECC Road Residents Forum requests BBMP to immediately regulate digging work  penalise violators  repair and asphalt the two roads.

Bad Patches,We are residents of Indiranagar 1st Stage and live very close to the newly opened pub  â€˜Three Dots and a Dashâ€™. This pub is located on the first floor and has an open terrace above that. The terrace has no soundproofing and the loud music disturbs the neighborhood.\n\nWe are writing to complain about the level of sound we are left to face almost on a daily basis. They are always playing very loud music that we can hear till late at night. Some of us have made calls to the police station at night to complain. When the police go there the music is turned down but after ten minutes the music goes up again. The music is loud on almost all evening/nights of the week and also on Sunday afternoons. We have given a written complaint to the Indiranagar police station with signatures from the people who live on the road behind where we live.\n\nAs neighbors we have gone and spoken to the owners  Vamsi  Siddharth and Raghu. We have also spoken to the operations manager Victor and another manager  Dennis. Despite these discussions and repeated requests from us to turn the music down nothing has been down about the level of sound. \n\nWe request you to please help initiate action to stop this nuisance. Most of the people affected by the sound are senior citizens who have been living here for many decades. It disturbs our sleep and peace on a regular basis.,Bad Patches,Minor repairs to municipal property,Major repairs to municipal property

Bad Patches,My wife the other day was driving rather slowly (she\'s a very careful rules-abiding person) from RICHMOND ROAD and taking a RIGHT TURN towards the RESIDENCY ROAD. And at the circle when she sees a GREEN signal  takes a turn (i.e. coming from LEFT-SIDE of Richmond Rd to the LEFT-SIDE of Residency Rd). But on request of the traffic police officer standing on the right-side of Residency Rd turns towards him. And the police officer says that she had defaulted a signal and puts a fine on her  which she pays.\n\nNow analyzing where she had made a mistake  we ask the officer why fine when she took a turn only on seeing the right-turn signal (which was still glowing as it had 15 secs more to go). He responds that the RIGHT-TURN signal is only for the RIGHT-SIDE riders on the RICHMOND ROAD  and NOT for the LEFT-SIDE riders of it  and also mentions that there was also a NO-RIGHT-TURN board put over there. This is purely a confusion for the riders on this road  esp those who do not ply on it regularly. And also goes on to state that the board was put there by the BBMP dept  hence Traffic Police is not answerable to it.\n\nNow can someone think about a driver too  and understand that the eyes aren\'t a 360 deg camera. Especially when someone sees a RIGHT-TURN-SIGNAL brightly glowing  they barely can presume that the same road will also have a NO-RIGHT-TURN board to be present as well. I hope the department  be it the Traffic Police or the BBMP also to be humans and probably agree to the same.\n\nA SIMPLE SOLUTION could\'ve been - have a RIGHT-TURN-SIGNAL on the RIGHT-SIDE of the the Richmond Rd so that riders on that side of the road only can see it  and take a turn  instead of putting the signal on a central location for both sides sides (on opposite side of the road). This probably could be a more rationale way of doing things  and LEFT-SIDE-riders when they do not see a signal will automatically oblige with whatever shown to them  and a NO-RIGHT-TURN board may not even be required perhaps. Plz do not CONFUSE the INNOCENT riders  and take undue advantage of their obedience to the law.\n\nBTW right while we were talking to the police officer  there were so many riders outrightly defaulting  jumping the red signal and other violations  and the officer was not even able to do anything about it. And when we question that  he rather says that do you want to be a good citizen or take the path of a bad one - strangely police likes to only take advantage of the innocent people  while they cannot do something about the serious offenders.\n\nHopefully the department(s) can do something about it for the future. Thank you.,Bad Patches,Person falling in Manhole,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain

Garbage not lifted from house gully,After the new culvert construction I am unable to take my car out from NRI Layout 2nd phase because of this unscientific construction across the road at 2 places. Firstly  the slab what they have used is so thick and the slope for that thickness is not provided there for the smooth traffic flow.

With access to the lake being only through private land there is the immediate need to gain permission to lay proper pipelines connecting the storm water drain to the lake. Who is to bell the cat ?? There is complete silence and indifference from the BBMP to resolve this issue. With the current status the new storm water drains are of no use. They will soon start overflowing  since they are not connected and do not flow into the lake !!,Bad Patches,Pre-monsoon works halted,Drainage chokes and blockages

Bad Patches,Our locality has the worst roads. The roads all around our layout is so bad that no car can pass through it without scraping its under belly. Our layout PRAGATHI NAGAR had excellent roads just a year back and a year after making the roads... They were dug to connect the drainage... But it\'s been around 4-5 months now but there is no work in progress. During dry days there is a thick layer of dust all over the house and car and during rainy season it is impossible to walk on the roads as your foot goes straight into the mud. If someone would take care of this situation it would be great...

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,I have been living in this city since the past year and in spite of having lived here for not that long I have seen enough. I feel disgusted at the sight of heaps of garbage at almost every end of the road. The heap not only pollutes and dirties the land but also leaves a very piercing and disturbing odour and also spoils the look of the surroundings which otherwise could be maintained as posh and tidy. The roads also get difficult to be used because of garbage heaps here and there and it all comes down to the cleanliness issue. If the roads are to be made dumping grounds then how are the local people expected to like living in this city? Even if garbage is dumped it must be made sure that it is cleaned and disposed off properly leaving no inconvenience for the  people living nearby.,Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,"Unauthorised stalls on roads, footpath or SWD drain",Bad Patches

Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,"There is something incongruous I noticed that I want to bring to ICMYC forum\'s attention: \nLocation: Byappanahalli Police Station.\nView angle: When driving on Old Madras Road  towards K.R.Puram\n\nObservation of three sign/banner/hoarding seen are given below:\n\nSign/Hoarding                       Area compared to all hoardings        Condition/Type\n\n1. Road directions                  ~03%                                  Poor... pole is bent. Signage seems to be of metal\n2. Crime alert chain snatching    ~28%                                  Okay.. However  poster is made of cloth = Temporary\n3. Commercial advertisement         ~69%                                  Solid pole appears to have been put up / commercial ad is nice to look at  and seems to be of lasting quality.\n\nWhile I understand Byappanahalli police station may not be a traffic police station  the relative inequality of the three categories of visual messages (in terms of devoted area and quality/condition of material) captures ones\' attention. This is especially given the hoarding is installed at a police station  and that too on a junction on a busy road. I find this hoarding a distraction. \n\nGiven  as a society  our atrocious driving habits  and dismal traffic safety record  should (a majority of) this space  & location  not be used for motorist awareness/education (e.g. cartoon of \""give way to ambulance\"" or \""stop behind stop line\"" etc)  rather than promote consumer  materialistic culture?\n\n(Probably a good topic for journalist type of people in ICMYC to look into)\n\n(Can someone please load a photograph of this location  from the view angle I am referring to?)\n\nACTION\n\nLeverage this advertisement space to prominently promote  first  a safe and courteous driving culture.\n\nBENEFIT\n\nHopefully  it influences \na) improved traffic behaviour  and \nb) improved perception of the police by the public.",Municipal Land - Road   Footpath   Strom Water Drain,Bad Patches,Hawkers

Heaps of garbage lies near the garbage area. Even the dust-bins remain full to capacity. They are not cleared for weeks. The stagnant pools of water while raining have become a breeding place for flies and mosquitoes. Stray dogs and animals surround the dustbins. An epidemic is expected any moment due to the unhygienic conditions here.\nComplaints lodged at the local office proved futile. The situation still remains the same. If immediate steps are not taken to improve the sanitary conditions of the locality  the life of the residents will be in danger  Moreover the people are using this place as Urinating which is a shameful act and for us to stay in this locality becoming huge trouble  every time we and our children required to visit the Doctors for irregular dirty air surrounded by the pollution.

Unauthorised Food Selling   Preparation,It is almost six months  I might have made entry in the complaint book of BSK TTMC office on the buses being parked on the road opp TTMC without entering the TTMC as well as commuters being made to alight at the unspecified point and to make a road crossing to connect the other buses on more than 10 occasions as well as several mails and mobile messages to CTMO  BMTC. Till now there is neither any acknowledgement nor any action taken to ensure the safety of commuters as it is the duty of the BMTC to ensure the passengers are made to alight at the bus stand and not on the road when they wish to connect the buses to onward journeys.  This adds to the inconvenience  as several buses does not enter the BSK TTMC bus stand and carries commuters who are on the unspecified locations wherein the commuters waiting at the TTMC have to bear the brunt of waiting for the next bus.  It is hoped that if the bmtc have the run on profit  it should discipline their staff such as drivers/conductors as well as depot inspectors who would be sitting inside the office.

Meanwhile I called the Police (100) control room and informed about the situation but to my horror even after calling them the second time no Police arrived at the scene for more than 1 hour. finally I had to give Rs. 500 to one of the auto drivers and as I was in great pain and leave the scene. I won\'t blame police as I later found out that the all police men were busy on duty for Independence day or BBMP election rally security. Please advise me on how solve this problem.
